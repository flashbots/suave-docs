:::info

[SUAVE-Viem](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-viem) is a fork of [viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem) that will eventually be upstreamed but is currently still in a dynamic state.

Sending Confidential Compute Requests works slightly differently, but most other functionality is similar to interacting with any other EVM chain from viem.

:::

This page describes how to work with the SUAVE-viem TypeScript SDK. The SDK simplifies interaction with the SUAVE Chain and provides easy-to-use functions to send transactions and query data. Below, you'll find steps on how to install the library and perform some basic actions.

## Installation

The [`@flashbots/suave-viem`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flashbots/suave-viem) package is available on NPM, and can be installed with any NPM-based package manager, such as **npm**, **yarn**, or **bun**.

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Instantiation

:::info

The rest of this guide assumes you have [SUAVE running locally](/tutorials/run-suave).

:::

First, you need to import necessary modules and instantiate the client. In your source code, you can copy and paste the following:

```typescript
import {http} from '@flashbots/suave-viem';
import {getSuaveProvider} from '@flashbots/suave-viem/chains/utils';

// connect to your local SUAVE node
const SUAVE_RPC_URL = 'http://localhost:8545';
const suaveProvider = getSuaveProvider(http(SUAVE_RPC_URL));
```

## Wallet Creation

To interact with the SUAVE network, we'll need a wallet. When running a local SUAVE devnet, there is an account which is set up with funds for you by default. If (when) you need this account again, you can find it here: [Pre-funded devnet accounts](/tutorials/run-suave#pre-funded-accounts).

To make a wallet, we'll import the `getSuaveWallet` function. We'll also need to import the `Hex` type to make sure our hex strings are properly formatted.

We'll make a wallet using the pre-funded account. Update your code to match, or you can just copy-paste the whole snippet over what you already wrote.

```typescript
// don't forget to include these new imports!
import {http, type Hex} from '@flashbots/suave-viem';
import {
  getSuaveProvider,
  getSuaveWallet
} from '@flashbots/suave-viem/chains/utils';

// connect to your local SUAVE node
const SUAVE_RPC_URL = 'http://localhost:8545';
const suaveProvider = getSuaveProvider(http(SUAVE_RPC_URL));

// create a wallet with the pre-funded devenet account
const PRIVATE_KEY: Hex =
  '0x91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12';
const wallet = getSuaveWallet({
  transport: http(SUAVE_RPC_URL),
  privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY,
});

console.log('Wallet Address:', wallet.account.address);
```

You can now run this file:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

And you should see the following printed to your terminal:

```bash
Wallet Address: 0xBE69d72ca5f88aCba033a063dF5DBe43a4148De0
```

## Watching Pending Transactions

Watch for pending transactions and log their details by adding the following code to the previous example:

```typescript
// Watch for pending transactions
suaveProvider.watchPendingTransactions({
  async onTransactions(transactions) {
    for (const hash of transactions) {
      try {
        const receipt = await suaveProvider.getTransactionReceipt({hash});
        console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching receipt:', error);
      }
    }
  },
});
```

If you're running this against a local devnet, you won't see any activity until you send some transactions. This is covered in the next section.

## Sending Requests

`suave-viem` can send confidential compute requests (CCRs) and traditional ethereum transactions. Here we provide examples of both.

:::info

This example continues building on the code from the previous sections. If you see something unfamiliar, check the code examples above to make sure you didn't miss anything.

In the following steps we'll be calling asynchronous functions, so we'll add an async `main` function to wrap our main program.

If you're following along with the example, add the following to the bottom of your code. This is where we'll put all of our code from now on.

```typescript
async function main() {
  // add your code here!
}

main();
```

‚ùó*Don't forget: Code snippets below should be added to the `main` function.*

:::

#### 1. Get current gas price

First, fetch the current gas price from the network.

```typescript
const gasPrice = await suaveProvider.getGasPrice();
```

#### 2. Prepare a transaction

To send transactions (or confidential requests), we need to import the `TransactionRequestSuave` type.

```typescript
import {type TransactionRequestSuave} from '@flashbots/suave-viem/chains/suave/types';
```

To make sure our everything is working, let's send some ether from the devnet account to itself.

```typescript
const gasPrice = await suaveProvider.getGasPrice();
const fundTx: TransactionRequestSuave = {
  to: wallet.account.address,
  value: 100000000000000001n,
  gasPrice,
  gas: 21000n,
  type: '0x0',
};
```

:::info FYI: Transaction Types

The Confidential Compute Request transaction type is `0x43`. This is the type you'll need to send data to your smart contracts confidentially.

If you're not sending confidential data, you can use the original ethereum tx types to send traditional transactions: `0x0` for legacy & `0x2` for EIP-1559.

:::

#### 3. Send a transaction and wait for confirmation

To sign and send the transaction request, we can use `wallet.sendTransaction`.

```typescript
const txHash = await wallet.sendTransaction(fundTx);
console.log('Sent tx', txHash);
```

*Alternatively*, if you need to sign the request without immediately sending it to suave, you can instead use `wallet.signTransaction` and `suaveProvider.sendRawTransaction`.

```typescript
const signedTx = await wallet.signTransaction(fundTx);
const txHash = await suaveProvider.sendRawTransaction({
  serializedTransaction: signedTx
});
```

If you followed the [Watching Pending Transactions](#watching-pending-transactions) section, you now should see your transaction's receipt show up in your console logs when you run the program.

Run the program again and you should see something like this:

```sh
$ bun run index.ts
Wallet Address: 0xBE69d72ca5f88aCba033a063dF5DBe43a4148De0
Sent tx: 0xcf95ee9d30d4c865444f60d03727b0c04f8738501b394ebc078e56eeb733a80a

  status: "success",
  to: "0xbe69d72ca5f88acba033a063df5dbe43a4148de0",
  transactionHash: "0xcf95ee9d30d4c865444f60d03727b0c04f8738501b394ebc078e56eeb733a80a",
  transactionIndex: 0,
  type: "legacy",
}
```

#### 4. Create a smart contract

CCRs must target a smart contract, so let's quickly deploy one to test with.


:::warning

If you're using git in your project, you'll need to stash or commit any uncommitted changes before executing this step.

:::

Initialize a new forge project within your typescript project. Then install `suave-std`.

```bash
forge init
forge install flashbots/suave-std
```

Now you should have a forge project alongside your typescript project. You'll have a `src/` directory and inside it, a file called `Counter.sol`.

Delete the contents of `Counter.sol` and copy the following snippet into the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "suave-std/suavelib/Suave.sol";
import {Suapp} from "suave-std/Suapp.sol";

contract Counter is Suapp {
    uint256 public number;

    event NumberSet(uint256 number);

    modifier confidential() {
        require(
            Suave.isConfidential(),
            "function must be called confidentially"
        );
        _;
    }

    function onSetNumber(uint256 newNumber) external {
        number = newNumber;
        emit NumberSet(newNumber);
    }

    function setNumber() public confidential returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory data = Suave.confidentialInputs();
        uint256 newNumber = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
        return abi.encodeWithSelector(this.onSetNumber.selector, newNumber);
    }
}
```

:::info Smart Contract Breakdown

In this simple contract, we have two functions `setNumber` & `onSetNumber`.

`onSetNumber` is the function that updates the number stored in our smart contract (in blockchain storage). As you'll see shortly, we don't call this function directly (though we could, but the inputs would be public).

`setNumber` is executed by a user sending a CCR. This function reads and decodes the confidential inputs from the request before returning the ABI-encoded calldata for calling `onSetNumber`.

Returning calldata from a function is how SUAVE separates onchain & offchain logic. When calling a function via CCR, the operations in that function are considered "offchain." If that function returns calldata, that calldata (function) is executed by the kettle as another transaction, and that call is considered "onchain."

:::

Also remove `test/Counter.t.sol` -- we won't need it for this example.

```bash
rm test/Counter.t.sol
```

#### 4a. Deploy smart contract

Any traditional method of smart contract deployment will work for suave. We like `anvil`.

Run the following commands to compile your smart contract and deploy it from the default devnet account.

```bash
forge build
forge create \
  --private-key 0x91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12 \
  src/Counter.sol:Counter
```

You should see output similar to this:

```txt
[‚†ä] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: 0xBE69d72ca5f88aCba033a063dF5DBe43a4148De0
Deployed to: 0xcF643f1BF7ed34487CFDA05894fA83119bF856E1
Transaction hash: 0xadffe4d4c312925dd368632bf473704c74c336493c51d0ffa7f0a5453fbedf13
```

‚ùóMake note of that "Deployed to" address. We'll need it in the next step.

If you're following the examples, let's export it as an environment variable so we have easy access to it when we run our Typescript program.

```bash
# replace this address with the one you get from `forge create`
export COUNTER_ADDRESS=0xcF643f1BF7ed34487CFDA05894fA83119bF856E1
```

#### 4b. Import the smart contract into our project

When you ran `forge build` you should have created (or updated) your `out/` directory. This is where forge keeps its build artifacts. We'll use this to get the ABI definition for our smart contract, so we can call its functions from Typescript.
We'll also need some helper functions from viem.

Add these to your existing imports:

```typescript
// helper functions & types
import {
  decodeEventLog,
  encodeAbiParameters,
  encodeFunctionData,
  type Address,
} from "@flashbots/suave-viem"
// smart contract build artifact
import Counter from "./out/Counter.sol/Counter.json";
```

#### 5. Create a Confidential Compute Request

In step 3, we sent a traditional ethereum transaction. Now, let's set up a confidential compute request (CCR) to send data to our smart contracts confidentially.

First, retrieve the smart contract address from the environment variable we set earlier (`COUNTER_ADDRESS`):

```typescript
if (!process.env.COUNTER_ADDRESS) {
  throw new Error('COUNTER_ADDRESS env var must be set');
}
const counterAddress = process.env.COUNTER_ADDRESS as Address;
```

Now we can assemble our CCR:

```typescript
const ccr: TransactionRequestSuave = {
  to: counterAddress,
  value: 0n,
  gasPrice: await suaveProvider.getGasPrice(),
  gas: 69000n,
  type: '0x43',
  data: encodeFunctionData({
    abi: Counter.abi,
    functionName: "setNumber",
  }),
  confidentialInputs: encodeAbiParameters([
    {type: 'uint256'}
  ], [
    13n
  ]),
  kettleAddress: "0xB5fEAfbDD752ad52Afb7e1bD2E40432A485bBB7F",
};
```

**What's going on here?**

- We specify transaction type `0x43` to indicate that this is a confidential compute request.
- We send the request to our smart contract (`counterAddress`) to call `setNumber` with confidential inputs.
- We call the `setNumber` function by ABI-encoding the function call in the `data` field, same as a traditional ethereum transaction.
- We provide our confidential data (also ABI-encoded) in the `confidentialInputs` field; this data is not revealed publicly, and is only known to the kettle.
- The `kettleAddress` we use is specific to the local devnet. On a public testnet, this value is different. If you're looking for that address you can find it [here](/tutorials/rigil).

:::info

`confidentialInputs` is a field to store information that should be kept private during computation, and the data field is the typical calldata required to interact with a dapp.

You can see more examples of how to craft your own CCRs in the [examples directory of suave-viem](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-viem/blob/main/examples/suave-web-demo/src/suave.ts).

:::

#### 5. Send the Confidential Compute Request

Finally, send the CCR to SUAVE.

```typescript
const ccrHash = await wallet.sendTransaction(ccr);
console.log(`sent ccr! tx hash: ${ccrHash}`);
```

You should see the transaction hash logged to your terminal, like this:

```bash
sent ccr! tx hash: 0xad488fd0a2b428bfa30c7ef8f8ce12e2f7f2554643ad1ca94d15ab11ad5dd9dd
```

To see the logs emitted by the `onSetNumber` function, use viem's `decodeEventLog` function. Following the example, replace the code from the [Watching Pending Transactions](#watching-pending-transactions) step with this snippet:

```typescript
suaveProvider.watchPendingTransactions({
  async onTransactions(transactions) {
    for (const hash of transactions) {
      try {
        const receipt = await suaveProvider.getTransactionReceipt({hash});
        console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
        if (receipt.status === 'success' && receipt.logs.length > 0) {
          const decodedLogs = decodeEventLog({
            abi: Counter.abi,
            ...receipt.logs[0],
          })
          console.log("decoded logs", decodedLogs)
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching receipt:', error);
      }
    }
  },
});
```

Lastly, press Ctrl+C to quit the example program.

For viem-related questions, the [viem docs](https://viem.sh/docs/introduction) are a great resource. suave-viem is just a fork of viem, so you can expect it to work pretty much the same as vanilla viem.
