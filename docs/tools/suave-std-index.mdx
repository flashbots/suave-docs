[SUAVE-STD](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-std) is a collection of Solidity contracts and libraries to help you create Suapps. It is included as a submodule in the [SUAPP Examples](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/) repo, which we used in the previous tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will be diving deeper into the different capabilities offered by `suave-std`.

:::info

`suave-std` is the main entrypoint for developers who are interacting with SUAVE. It is a place to create building blocks, sdks, and common patterns that are useful to SUAVE developers.

:::

Some functionalities that `suave-std` will help you handle include:

- üí± Transaction parsing and construction
- üîß JSON object decoding and encoding
- ‚ôæÔ∏è A wrapper for all the precompiles to make calling any of them more convenient

## Transactions

Encoding and decoding transactions from other chains is often necessary when matching different transactions in an [order flow](https://writings.flashbots.net/illuminate-the-order-flow) auction, or turning bundles into (partial) blocks in a block building contract, or weaving together different transactions on different chains for your unique use case.

Having to encode and decode such transactions is a pain, which is exactly the sort of scenario where `suave-std` can help:

```solidity
import "suave-std/Transactions.sol";

contract Example {
    function example() {
        Transactions.Legacy memory legacyTxn0 = Transactions.Legacy({
            to: address(0x095E7BAea6a6c7c4c2DfeB977eFac326aF552d87),
            gas: 50000,
            gasPrice: 10,
            value: 10,
            ...
        });

        // Encode to RLP
        bytes memory rlp = Transactions.encodeRLP(legacyTxn0);

        // Decode from RLP
        Transactions.Legacy memory legacyTxn1 = Transactions.decodeRLP(rlp);
    }
}
```

## SUAVE Enabled Tests

It can also be difficult to test specific precompiles when using Forge. In order to make this possible, `suave-std` provides a "SUAVE-enabled" test contract, which you can import and use like this:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "suave-std/Test.sol";
import "suave-std/Suave.sol";

contract TestForge is Test, SuaveEnabled {
    address[] public addressList = [0xC8df3686b4Afb2BB53e60EAe97EF043FE03Fb829];

    function testConfidentialStore() public {
        Suave.DataRecord memory record = Suave.newDataRecord(0, addressList, addressList, "namespace");

        bytes memory value = abi.encode("suave works with forge!");
        Suave.confidentialStore(record.id, "key1", value);

        bytes memory found = Suave.confidentialRetrieve(record.id, "key1");
        assertEq(keccak256(found), keccak256(value));
    }
}
```

## MevShare

While not yet in the main branch of `suave-geth`, the [MevShare library](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/feature/suave-std/suave/sol/suave-std/mevshare.sol) illustrates all of the major functionality we've discussed so far.

## MevBoost

The same is true for the [MevBoost library](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/feature/suave-std/suave/sol/suave-std/mevboost.sol).

The goal of these two libraries is to illustrate how products and services which currently rely on a known set of actors to run can be encoded as smart contracts on SUAVE, and made to work on an open, permissionless network.

It is in this sense that we make the claim that applications built on SUAVE can interface with any component in the [MEV supply network](/concepts/mev-supplychain-interface).
