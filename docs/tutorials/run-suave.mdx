# Run SUAVE Locally

Our first goal is to start a "Kettle". Kettles house all components necessary to perform confidential compute and are the main protocol actor in the SUAVE protocol.

Here is the architecture of a node on the Rigil Testnet. We'll be running all the stuff within the purple square.

You can read more about exactly what a Kettle contains in [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).

## Get Started

There are two different approaches you can take to local setup:

1. [Building from source](#building-from-source)
2. [Docker](#using-docker)

### Clone the [suave-geth](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/) repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:flashbots/suave-geth.git
```

### Building from source

Build the binary:

```bash
cd suave-geth && make suave
```

Now you have the `suave` binary in your Go bin directory. You can check this by running:

```bash
which suave
suave --version
```

Start the local devnet with:

```bash
suave --suave.dev
```

        If you are seeing:
        <pre>"cp: cannot create regular file '/bin/suave': Permission denied"</pre>
        it is most likely because you have not set your GOPATH correctly. You can
        do so by running:  
        <pre>export GOPATH=$HOME/go</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

  <summary>Missing packages</summary>
  <div>

        If you have set up a new machine to run through this, you'll also need
        to install Make and Go:
        <pre>sudo apt install make golang-go</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Using Docker

Spin up the local devnet with docker-compose:

```bash
make devnet-up
```

You can check that the containers are running with:

```bash
docker ps
```

And you can stop the local devnet with:

```bash
make devnet-down
```

On MacOS, the above should work out of the box with Docker Desktop. If you're using Linux, you may run into some of the issues below:

  <summary>1. Docker permission errors</summary>

    <div>
      <div>
        On Linux, it is best to create a new user group for Docker, rather than run
        the above command as sudo. You can do by running:
        <pre>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>2. Docker not running</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Make sure that Docker is running. On most Linux machines, you can do
        this with:
        <pre>sudo systemctl start docker</pre>
        You can check the current status with:
        <pre>sudo systemctl status docker</pre>
        If you installed Docker and still run into issues with docker-compose,
        you can try:
        <pre>sudo apt install docker-compose</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. Unsupported version</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        If you're running an older version of Docker, you may get a message that
        looks like this:
        <pre>
          ERROR: Version in "././suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" is unsupported.
        </pre>
        Go to the file in "/suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" and change the
        first line to use <b>3.3</b> rather than <b>3.8</b>.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Testing the devnet

**Create a few example transactions:**

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

**Execute a RPC request with curl like this:**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8545' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":83 }'
```

---

If you built from source (but not if you're running Docker), you can attach to the usual Geth javascript console to get any interactive data you need with:

```bash
suave attach /tmp/geth.ipc
```

From within the console, you can run:

```bash
eth.accounts[0]
```

This should return `"0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f"` - the defaul funded account for local development.
```bash
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
```

Should return a really large number `1.1579...e+77`. If you try `eth.getBalance("<your_new_address>")` instead, you should see `0`.

If you try:

```bash
web3.eth.blockNumber
```

It should tell you the block height of your local network.
