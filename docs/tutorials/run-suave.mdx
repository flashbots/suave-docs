You can use `suave-geth` to start a local SUAVE devnet.

There are two ways to work with `suave-geth`:

1. ‚ö° [Install the latest release binary](#latest-release-binary)
2. üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Build from source](#building-from-source)

### Latest release binary

```bash
curl -L https://suaveup.flashbots.net | bash
```

Start your local devnet with:

```bash
suave-geth --suave.dev
```

The `--suave.dev` flag sets some defaults which are useful when developing on SUAVE.

### Building from source

:::info

We recommend that you use Golang v1.21 or newer.

:::

Clone the [suave-geth](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/) repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
```

Build the binary:

```bash
make suave
```

Start the local devnet with:

```bash
./build/bin/suave-geth --suave.dev
```

You can check that the `suave` binary is available in `./build/bin/` with:

```bash
./build/bin/suave-geth --version
```

        If you have set up a new machine to run through this, you'll also need
        to install Make and Go:
        <pre>sudo apt install make golang-go</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

### Testing the devnet

**Compile the example contracts:**

        `forge` is a part of the smart contract development toolchain we use in our examples, which you can learn more about in our [next tutorial](/tutorials/deploy-contracts). If you do not have it installed, you can do so quickly with: 
        <pre>curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

```bash
cd suave && forge build
```

**Create a few example transactions:**

```bash
go run devenv/cmd/main.go
```

**Execute a RPC request with curl like this:**

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8545' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":83 }'
```

If you built from source (but not if you're running Docker), you can attach to the usual Geth javascript console to get any interactive data you need with:

```bash
./build/bin/suave-geth attach /tmp/geth.ipc
```

<details>
  <summary>IPC not found</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        It may be the case, especially if you have a custom GOPATH, that the geth.ipc is somewhere else. You can either force the path using the `--ipcpath` flag when starting SUAVE, or find the path in the logs (it could look something like `/System/Volumes/Data/private/var/folders/rt/gq5bhvy17wz5z5dl32_x83dw0000gp/T/geth.ipc`, for instance).
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

From within the console, you can run:

```bash
eth.accounts[0]
```

This should return `"0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f"` - the default funded account for local development.

```bash
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
```

Should return a really large number `1.1579...e+77`. If you try `eth.getBalance("<your_new_address>")` instead, you should see `0`.

If you try:

```bash
web3.eth.blockNumber
```

It should tell you the block height of your local network.

### What am I actually running?

The main actor in the SUAVE protocol is called a "Kettle". Kettles house all components necessary to perform confidential compute.

Here is the architecture of a Kettle on the Rigil Testnet. When you start a local SUAVE devnet, you're running all the stuff in the purple square (but not the domain specific services, i.e. nodes connected to other chains from/to which you wish to receive or send bundles).

You can read more about exactly what a Kettle contains in [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).
