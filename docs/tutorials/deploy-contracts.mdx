# Deploy A Contract

The previous two tutorials have encouraged you run SUAVE locally. However, the Rigil Testnet is up and running, so you should be able to deploy contracts to it without building everything yourself.

This tutorial is therefore divided into four sections:

1. [Deploy to Rigil using Forge](#forge-and-rigil)
2. [Deploy locally using the Golang SDK](#golang-sdk-local)
3. [Deploy to Rigil using the Golang SDK](#golang-sdk-and-rigil)
4. [Deploy to Rigil using Remix](#remix-and-rigil)

## SUAPP Examples

First, let's clone and set up the [SUAPP examples repo](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/), which comes with a number of different example contracts to illustrate the different precompiles and patterns you can start learning.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:flashbots/suapp-examples.git && cd suapp-examples
```

You'll notice that `suave-geth` is included as a git submodule in this example repo, so we need to initialize it:

```bash
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

We'll also need to install Foundry in order to help us compile our contracts and prepare them for deployment:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

You can compile all the contracts in the repo with:

```bash
forge build
```

### Forge and Rigil

:::info

First, get some rETH for the account you want to use from the **[Rigil ETH Faucet](https://faucet.rigil.suave.flashbots.net)**. Make sure you can access the private key of this account.

:::

Deploying any of the example contracts in the SUAPP Examples repo with forge is as easy as running:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.rigil.suave.flashbots.net --legacy \
--private-key <your_funded_priv_key> examples/onchain-state/onchain-state.sol:OnChainState
```

You should see the results of the compilation logged in your terminal, followed by something like this:

```bash
Deployer: 0x5f3371793285920351344a1EaaAA48d45e600652
Deployed to: 0x9A76Bb7AF996327828425f6db39a520f148F72DE
Transaction hash: 0x53c808935ee6da2ce1f076b4088440c322bb7a098cc000eaa8653be28ee75a33
```

### Golang SDK Local

:::info

This section requires having `suave-geth` on your local machine in order to deploy your contracts.

:::

First, you need to build and run SUAVE locally, which you can do (after you have cloned and initialized the repo) with:

```bash 
cd suave-geth && make suave && suave --suave.dev
```

Finally, we can deploy and transact with any of the example contracts. Just `cd` into the relevant directory and run the `main.go` file. For instance, to deploy and transact with the example contract which demonstrates how updating state works for normal vs confidential requests, you can run:

```bash
cd examples/onchain-state && go run main.go
```

You should see this message printed in your terminal if successful:

```bash
1. Send a confidential request that cannot modify the state
2. Send a confidential request that modifies the state
```

All of the `main.go` files use the Golang SDK, which you can read more about in our [developer guides](/developers/golang-sdk).

### Golang SDK and Rigil

:::info

This section requires that you have `suave-geth` on your local machine. However, you do not have to run SUAVE locally. You can deploy your contracts directly to Rigil and interact with them there using the methods available in the SDK.

:::

First, get some rETH for the account you want to use from the [Rigil ETH Faucet](https://faucet.rigil.suave.flashbots.net). Make sure you can access the private key of this account.

Clone the SUAPP Examples repo as above, making sure to initialize and update the submodules. Then, edit the `DefaultConfig` of `framework/framework.go` to look something like this (with the private key replaced):

```go
func DefaultConfig() *Config {
	return &Config{
		KettleRPC:  "https://rpc.rigil.suave.flashbots.net",
		KettleAddr: common.HexToAddress("03493869959c866713c33669ca118e774a30a0e5"),
		FundedAccount: NewPrivKeyFromHex("<your_funded_priv_key>"),
	}
}
```

Now, you should be able to deploy and transact with any of the contracts in the repo. For instance, try running:

```bash
cd examples/onchain-state && go run main.go
```

You should again see output like this logged in your terminal:

```bash
1. Send a confidential request that cannot modify the state
2. Send a confidential request that modifies the state
```

## Remix and Rigil

:::warning

This method is the quickest, but also the most limited. You can deploy contracts using Remix and an injected web3 provider. However, you cannot send Confidential Compute Requests to those contracts from providers like MetaMask, so it is difficult to interact with your contracts once deployed.

:::

Follow these steps to deploy a contract via Remix:

1. Add the Rigil RPC to your MetaMask or equivalent wallet and connect to it:

<RPCButton />

2. Get some rETH for your connected account from the [Rigil ETH Faucet](https://faucet.rigil.suave.flashbots.net)
3. Go to the [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org/) and navigate to the bottom icon on the right-hand menu: "Deploy and Run Transactions".
4. Open the dropdown "Environment" menu and select "Injected Provider - MetaMask". It should show `Custom (16813125) network` directly below that field if this works correctly.
5. Write (or import) your contracts in the File Explorer tab, compile them, and deploy them as you usually would.
