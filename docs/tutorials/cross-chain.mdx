# Cross-Chain Suapps

It is often the case that Suapps need to connect to two (or more!) different blockchains in order to be effective.

## `suavex-foundry`

The other option is to spoof Ethereum L1 (or chains like it) using Anvil, a tool which is also well suited to making your cross-chain life easier. 

For this reason, we maintain a [fork of foundry](https://github.com/flashbots/suavex-foundry) which specifically implements [`suavex_call`](/technical/specs/toliman/mevm#suavex-namepspace). The historical context for this tool can be found in [this forum post](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/anvil-for-mevm-external-provider/3114).

The idea is that, instead of running your own L1 node, you simply run Anvil via an RPC provider, and use that to test any croos chain interactions:

1. clone the repo & go into its directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suavex-foundry
cd suavex-foundry
```
2. run anvil with cargo:

```bash
export RPC_URL=https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MAINNET_RPC_URL
cargo run --bin anvil -- -p 8555 --chain-id 1 -f $RPC_URL
```

The creator of `suavex-foundry` wrote an example Suapp called [unisuapp](https://github.com/zeroXbrock/unisuapp), which features a simple intent-based public mempool and solver-driven intent execution using Uniswap v2. Unisuapp illustrates well how to use `suavex-foundry` to test Suapps that work across chains. You can get it running by following these steps:

1. Clone the repo and enter its directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeroXbrock/unisuapp
cd unisuapp
```

2. Populate `.env`, which uses pre-funded default accounts

```bash
echo "L1_CHAIN_ID=1
L1_KEY=ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
L1_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8555
SUAVE_KEY=91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12
SUAVE_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545" > .env
```

3. Install solidity dependencies & build contracts

```bash
forge install
forge build
```

4. Install NPM dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

5. Run `suave-geth` with the external-whitelist flag:

```bash
suave-geth --suave.dev --suave.eth.external-whitelist='*'
```

6. Run the script with DEPLOY set to deploy the contracts. Deployed contract address will be saved to `addresses.json`:

```bash
DEPLOY=true bun run index.ts
```

7. Run the script again without deploying to see the logic at work:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Kurtosis

There is a [kurtosis setup](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/blob/main/README.md#start-the-local-devnet) for the [private Order Flow Auction Suapp example](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/tree/main/examples/app-ofa-private): this example demonstrates the flexibility and power of SUAVE, as it happens across two different chains, which creates some infrastructure and testing challenges. Kurtosis + Docker is one way to make this slightly easier and ensure that you have all the services running that you need to execute and test all your Suapp's intended actions.
