# Build SUAPPs

This tutorial will show you how to build a SUAPP using `suave-viem`, our [typescript SDK](/resources/sdks/typescript-sdk), and two different [SUAPP example contracts](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/).

:::info

There are two different templates you can use for your SUAPP. One with minimal, typescript-only dependencies; and one which uses Next.

:::

## Set up `suave-viem`

Clone the repo: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:flashbots/suave-viem.git && cd suave-viem
```
Use [bun](https://bun.sh/) to install the dependencies and build the package:

```bash
bun install && bun run build
```
Symlink your newly built package in the global directory:

```bash
cd src/ && bun link
```

### Notes

1. Confidential Compute Requests on SUAVE do not work with wallets that implement the EIP-1193 Javascript API. Therefore, we use the unsafe `eth_sign` method to sign CCRs, which does work, but requires that you enable this functionality in wallets like MetaMask.
    1. To do so in MetaMask, go to "Settings" -> "Advanced" -> scroll to bottom -> switch Eth_sign requests on.
2. Both templates assume that you are running SUAVE locally.
3. No tests are included for the contracts, as it is not trivial to test new precompiles and different transaction types (i.e. CCRs) in `forge` at this time.

## Typescript Template

This template can be found directly in the `suave-viem` repo under [`examples/suave-web-demo`](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-viem/tree/main/examples/suave-web-demo). Continuing on from above, you can setup the template by running:

```bash
cd ../examples/suave-web-demo/ && bun install
```

This template use `forge` to handle the contracts it interacts with. You will need to compile them, which can be done with:

```bash
bun run compile
```

Now you can start the frontend with:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This template uses the same MEV-Share example contract we worked with using the [Golang SDK in the previous tutorial](/tutorials/send-transactions).

> _If you're struggling with any of the above, you can also find this pure typescript template as a standalone repo [here](https://github.com/andytudhope/build-a-suapp-ts)._


## Next Template

This template comes with a more extensive frontend framework, which uses Next (in typescript) and therefore depends on React. You can get it running by first cloning the repo and installing its dependencies. Make sure you have previously built and symlinked suave-viem for this to work:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:andytudhope/build-a-suapp-next-ts.git \
&& cd build-a-suapp-next-ts \
&& yarn
```

Setup `forge` to compile your contracts:

```bash
cd packages/forge/ && forge install && forge build
```

Deploy the compiled contracts from the root directory (you need to have [SUAVE running locally](/tutorials/run-suave) for this to work):

```bash
chmod +x packages/forge/deploy && yarn contracts:deploy 
```

You can start the frontend with:

```bash
yarn fe:dev
```

## Conclusion

You now have two different templates from which to begin building your own SUAPP ðŸ’ƒ.

These templates demonstrate how to interact with SUAVE confidentially, both directly and with data from another domain. Follow the [next tutorial to understand how](/tutorials/confidential-compute-requests).

Good luck and happy building âš¡ðŸ¤–.
