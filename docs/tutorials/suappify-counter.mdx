Our goal in this tutorial is to take the `Counter.sol` starter contract in Forge and turn it into a fully functioning Suapp. 

## Setup 

Ideally, this tutorial contains what you need to know to turn your existing smart contracts into Suapps. In order to demonstrate the essentials, let's start a new project and work with the standard Forge templates.

```bash
mkdir suapp && cd suapp 
forge init
forge install flashbots/suave-std
```

## Adjust Counter.sol

Delete the contents of `src/Counter.sol` and copy the following snippet into the file:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "suave-std/suavelib/Suave.sol";
import {Suapp} from "suave-std/Suapp.sol";

contract Counter is Suapp {
    uint256 public number;

    event NumberSet(uint256 number);

    modifier confidential() override {
        require(
            Suave.isConfidential(),
            "function must be called confidentially"
        );
        _;
    }

    function onSetNumber(uint256 newNumber) external emitOffchainLogs {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function setNumber() public confidential returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory data = Suave.confidentialInputs();
        uint256 newNumber = abi.decode(data, (uint256));
        emit NumberSet(newNumber);
        return abi.encodeWithSelector(this.onSetNumber.selector, newNumber);
    }
}
```

We've adjusted `setNumber` and changed `increment` to `onSetNumber`.

`onSetNumber` behaves like our "onchain" function from previous tutorials, and updates the number stored in our smart contract. As you'll see shortly, we don't call this function directly (though we could, but the inputs would be public).

:::info

The "onchain" functions we've been usng throughout our docs are required to be public, which may present a challenge in certain use cases where you want to always restrict who can call them. A community contributor solved this by restricting access to methods with a modifier requiring a secret. It's called [ConfidentialControl](https://github.com/halo3mic/suave-playground/blob/9afe269ab2da983ca7314b68fcad00134712f4c0/contracts/blockad/lib/ConfidentialControl.sol) and you can see an [example usage here](https://github.com/halo3mic/suave-playground/blob/9afe269ab2da983ca7314b68fcad00134712f4c0/contracts/blockad/BlockAdV2.sol).

:::

`setNumber` is executed by a user sending a CCR and behaves like the "offchain" functions from previous tutorials.

> **Make sure to remove `test/Counter.t.sol`: we won't need it for this example.**

Now you can build the new contract and deploy it (make sure `suave-geth` is running locally so you have somewhere to deploy to):

```bash
forge build
```
```bash
suave-geth spell deploy Counter.sol:Counter
```

You should see an output like this:

```bash
INFO [06-26|18:36:34.957] Running with local devchain settings 
INFO [06-26|18:36:34.970] Hash of the result onchain transaction   hash=0xf92a68badb9cdd8325b5ac3de9a3892de3531ae67f0480f9bbfe14487aedd960
INFO [06-26|18:36:34.970] Waiting for the transaction to be mined... 
INFO [06-26|18:36:35.073] Transaction mined                        status=1 blockNum=1
INFO [06-26|18:36:35.073] Contract deployed                        address=0xd594760B2A36467ec7F0267382564772D7b0b7
```

Finally, set the address your contract was deployed at as a env variable:

```bash
export COUNTER_ADDRESS=<your_contract_address>
```

## Using the Typescript SDK 

Building your own frontend for this new `Counter.sol` contract can take a great variety of forms. Therefore, rather than assume a framework for you, we'll demonstrate how to write generic Typescript to interact with your contract, which you can use in whichever frontend framework you prefer.

We also maintain a [Golang SDK](/tools/golang-sdk) if you would prefer to use that.

Let's create an `index.ts` file to demonstrate. Paste the below code into it:

```ts
import {
    http, 
    decodeEventLog, 
    encodeAbiParameters, 
    encodeFunctionData, 
    type Address, 
    type Hex
} from '@flashbots/suave-viem';
import {
  getSuaveProvider,
  getSuaveWallet,
  type TransactionRequestSuave
} from '@flashbots/suave-viem/chains/utils';
import Counter from "./out/Counter.sol/Counter.json";

const SUAVE_RPC_URL = 'http://localhost:8545';
const suaveProvider = getSuaveProvider(http(SUAVE_RPC_URL));

// create a wallet with the pre-funded devenet account
const PRIVATE_KEY: Hex =
  '0x91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12';
const wallet = getSuaveWallet({
  transport: http(SUAVE_RPC_URL),
  privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY,
});

async function main() {
    if (!process.env.COUNTER_ADDRESS) {
        throw new Error('COUNTER_ADDRESS env var must be set');
    }
    const counterAddress = process.env.COUNTER_ADDRESS as Address;

    suaveProvider.watchPendingTransactions({
        async onTransactions(transactions) {
          for (const hash of transactions) {
            try {
              const receipt = await suaveProvider.getTransactionReceipt({hash});
              console.log('Transaction Receipt:', receipt);
              if (receipt.status === 'success' && receipt.logs.length > 0) {
                const decodedLogs = decodeEventLog({
                  abi: Counter.abi,
                  ...receipt.logs[0],
                })
                console.log("decoded logs", decodedLogs)
              }
            } catch (error) {
              console.error('Error fetching receipt:', error);
            }
          }
        },
    });

    const gasPrice = await suaveProvider.getGasPrice();

    const ccr: TransactionRequestSuave = {
        to: counterAddress,
        chainId: 16813125,
        value: 0n,
        gasPrice,
        gas: 690000n,
        type: '0x43',
        data: encodeFunctionData({
          abi: Counter.abi,
          functionName: "setNumber",
        }),
        isEIP712,
        confidentialInputs: encodeAbiParameters([
          {type: 'uint256'}
        ], [
          13n
        ]),
        kettleAddress: "0xB5fEAfbDD752ad52Afb7e1bD2E40432A485bBB7F",
    };

    await wallet.sendTransaction(ccr);
}
  
main();
```

The most critical part to understand is crafting and sending Confidential Compute Requests:

1. We specify transaction type `0x43` to indicate that this is a Confidential Compute Request.
2. We send the request to our smart contract (`counterAddress`) to call `setNumber` with confidential inputs.
3. We call the `setNumber` function by ABI-encoding the function call in the `data` field, the same as you would for an ethereum transaction.
4. We specify `isEIP712` (a boolean which defaults to `true` above), to signify that the request should be signed as EIP712 signed typed data. This is particularly useful as it allows users to interact with Suave without ever changing their RPC endpoint. We recommend you always set it to `true`.
5. We provide our confidential data (also ABI-encoded) in the `confidentialInputs` field; this data is not revealed publicly, and is only known to the kettle.
6. The `kettleAddress` we use is specific to the local devnet. On a public testnet, this value is different. If you're looking for that address you can find it [here](/toliman).

:::info

`confidentialInputs` is a field to store information that should be kept private during computation, and the data field is the typical calldata required to interact with a dapp.

You can see more examples of how to craft your own CCRs in the [examples directory of suave-viem](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-viem/blob/main/examples/suave-web-demo/src/suave.ts).

:::

There are two ways to run this file: you can either use [bun](https://bun.sh) or, if you don't want to install a new tool, we can work around with Node:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bun" label="bun">
    ```bash
    bun add @flashbots/suave-viem
    bun run index.ts
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="node" label="node">
    Node can't run typescript off-the-bat, so we'll first need to install `node-ts`:
    
    ```bash
    npm i @flashbots/suave-viem
    npm i -D ts-node
    ```

    Paste this into a new `tsconfig.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es2020",
        "module": "commonjs",
        "strict": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "resolveJsonModule": true
        }
    }
    ```

    Adjust your package.json to inlude `"type": "commonjs"`, and now you should be able to run:

    ```bash
    npx ts-node index.ts
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In either case, you should see something like this printed to your terminal:

```bash

  blockHash: "0xee533da6fad9ae95b7b3f5dd74711d011b0c984490274b3936159c5555e72e32",
