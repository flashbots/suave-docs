import List from '@site/src/components/List/List.tsx';

[suave-std](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-std) is a collection of Solidity contracts and libraries to help you create Suapps. It is included as a submodule in the [SUAPP Examples](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/) repo, which we used in the previous tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will be diving deeper into the different capabilities offered by `suave-std`.

:::info 

`suave-std` is the main entrypoint for developers who are interacting with SUAVE. It is a place to create building blocks, sdks, and common patterns that are useful to SUAVE developers.

:::

The core functionalities that `suave-std` will help you handle include:

<List>

transaction parsing and construction

JSON object decoding and encoding

convenience wrapper around precompiles

</List>

## Libraries

### Transactions.sol

Helper library that defines types and encoding/decoding methods for the Ethereum transaction types.

#### Example usage

```solidity
import "suave-std/Transactions.sol";

contract Example {
    function example() {
        Transactions.Legacy memory legacyTxn0 = Transactions.Legacy({
            to: address(0x095E7BAea6a6c7c4c2DfeB977eFac326aF552d87),
            gas: 50000,
            gasPrice: 10,
            value: 10,
            ...
        });

        // Encode to RLP
        bytes memory rlp = Transactions.encodeRLP(legacyTxn0);

        // Decode from RLP
        Transactions.Legacy memory legacyTxn1 = Transactions.decodeRLP(rlp);
    }
}
```

### MevShare.sol

not in main branch yet but will be soon https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/feature/suave-std/suave/sol/suave-std/mevshare.sol

```solidity
    struct Bundle {
            string version;
            uint64 inclusionBlock;
            bytes[] bodies;
            bool[] canRevert;
            uint8[] refundPercents;
        }

    function encodeBundle(Bundle memory bundle) internal view returns (bytes memory)
    function sendBundle(string memory url, Bundle memory bundle) internal view 
    function toMinimalHexString(bytes memory value) internal pure returns (string memory str)

```

### MevBoost.sol

 ```solidity
    function encode(Payload memory payload) internal view returns (bytes memory) 
    function submitBlock(string memory baseUrl, SubmitBlockRequest memory bundle) internal view
    function toMinimalHexString(bytes memory value) private pure returns (string memory str)

    struct Bid {
        uint64 slot;
        bytes parentHash;
        bytes blockHash;
        bytes builderPubkey; // bytes48
        bytes proposerPubkey; // bytes48
        address proposerFeeRecipient;
        uint64 gasLimit;
        uint64 gasUsed;
        uint256 value;
    }

    struct Withdrawal {
        uint64 index;
        uint64 validatorIndex;
        address addr;
        uint256 amount;
    }

    struct Payload {
        bytes parentHash;
        address feeRecipient;
        bytes stateRoot;
        bytes receiptsRoot;
        bytes logsBloom;
        bytes prevRandao;
        uint64 blockNumber;
        uint64 gasLimit;
        uint64 gasUsed;
        uint64 timestamp;
        bytes extraData;
        bytes baseFeePerGas;
        bytes blockHash;
        bytes[] transactions;
        Withdrawal[] withdrawals;
    }

    struct SubmitBlockRequest {
        Bid bid;
        Payload payload;
        bytes signature;
    }
 ```
