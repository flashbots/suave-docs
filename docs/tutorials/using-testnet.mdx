## Deploy Contracts 

The `spell` tool we've been using in all our previous tutorials is only intended for local use. Therefore, we'll need to adapt our approach slightly in order to get our contract working on the testnet, and start transacting there.

1. Get rETH from the [faucet](https://faucet.toliman.suave.flashbots.net/).
2. Use Forge. From the root of your contracts directory, you can run:

```bash 
forge create --rpc-url https://rpc.toliman.suave.flashbots.net --legacy \
--private-key <your_funded_priv_key> <your_contract_name>.sol:<your_contract_name>
```

:::info

Note the `--legacy` flag: transactions on SUAVE are not EIP1559 compliant, which you will likely need to take into account no matter which smart contract framework you use.

:::

You should see something like this printed to your console:

```bash
...relevant compilation results...
Deployer: 0xBE69d72ca5f88aCba033a063dF5DBe43a4148De0
Deployed to: 0xcbdF0322Cd79212e10b0dB72D775aE05B99c1796
Transaction hash: 0x9ae80af40bdafbc706108446dbbf7761a59f5bf544b46c97b9b0851dddaa3927
```

## Sending Transactions 

We support both a [Golang SDK](/tools/golang-sdk) and a [typescript SDK](/tools/typescript-sdk) to help you deploy contracts and send confidential compute requests.

### Typescript SDK 

In the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/suappify-counter#using-the-typescript-sdk), we demonstrated how to use this SDK to craft CCRs in your local environment. The process is exactly the same for our SUAVE testnet: you just need to change the proivder url (and you can use the developer Kettle for sending transactions if the faucet doesn't work):

```ts
const SUAVE_RPC_URL = 'http://localhost:8545';
...
const PRIVATE_KEY: Hex =
  '0x6c45335a22461ccdb978b78ab61b238bad2fae4544fb55c14eb096c875ccfc52';
```

Otherwise the process is exactly the same as in your local environment.

### Golang SDK

The most effective way to begin with the Golang SDK is to use the same [`framework.go`](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/blob/main/framework/framework.go) used for all the `suapp-examples`, as it implements everything you need for interacting with your contracts.

Its use is demonstrated in the [`main.go`](https://github.com/flashbots/suapp-examples/blob/main/examples/app-ofa-private/main.go) in each example, from which you should be able to learn everything from deploying contracts to sending custom confidential compute requests from various different actors.
