:::warning

Sending transactions requires that you use either the Golang or Typescript SDKs we have made available. Confidential Compute Requests (CCRs) are not EIP-1193 compatible so you won't be able to sign CCRs directly from Metamask or providers like it.

:::

The [previous tutorial illustrated](/tutorials/deploy-contracts) how to deploy a series of example contracts using the Golang SDK and, in the first tutorial, you [setup SUAVE and then ran a script to "test the devnet"](/tutorials/run-suave#testing-the-devnet). 

> This tutorial will reiterate how contract deployment works, **and show you how to craft the transactions** that occur in [this script](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

## MEV-Share Example

The `suave-geth` repo has an [example version of MEV-Share](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers/bids.sol#L65). The script we'll be walking through does four things:

1. deploy the MEV-Share contract
2. sign and submit a transaction to be back run
3. grab the extracted hint from onchain
4. sign a back run transaction and submit it

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

Let's break down what this script is doing.

### Step 1: Create and Fund Test Accounts

```go
testAddr1 = generatePrivKey()
testAddr2 = generatePrivKey()

if err := fundAccount(mevmClt, testAddr1.Address(), fundBalance); err != nil {
    return err
}
fmt.Printf("- Funded test account: %s (%s)\n", testAddr1.Address().Hex(), fundBalance.String())
```

- Generate two new private keys representing test accounts.
- Fund these test accounts with a specified amount of Ether to simulate transactions.

### Step 2: Deploy MEV-Share Contract

```go
// Code snippet related to the step
txnResult, err := sdk.DeployContract(mevShareArtifact.Code, mevmClt)
```

- Deploy the MEV-Share smart contract to the SUAVE chain using the bytecode and a client instance.
- Confirm the deployment by checking the transaction receipt status.

### Step 3: Send Confidential Compute Request

:::info

The word "bid" is an artefact of early development. It refers to a generic "Data Identifier" used when operating on confidential data. In this context, a "bid" refers to the Ethereum L1 transaction data the is stored by the MEVM when we send it a CCR.

:::

In practice, this transaction would be sent by a user of another blockchain who wants to share any MEV the transaction might create in that domain with searchers listening for hints on SUAVE.

```go
    refundPercent := 10
    bundle := &types.SBundle{
        Txs:             types.Transactions{ethTxn1},
        RevertingHashes: []common.Hash{},
        RefundPercent:   &refundPercent,
    }
    bundleBytes, _ := json.Marshal(bundle)

    targetBlock := uint64(1)
    allowedPeekers := []common.Address{mevShareContract.Address()}

    confidentialDataBytes, _ := bundleBidContract.Abi.Methods["fetchBidConfidentialBundleData"].Outputs.Pack(bundleBytes)

    txnResult, err := mevShareContract.SendTransaction("newBid", []interface{}{targetBlock + 1, allowedPeekers, []common.Address{}}, confidentialDataBytes)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
```

- Craft a Confidential Compute Request using the MEV-Share contract function `newBid`.
- Serialize the bundle of transactions to include in the CCR.
- Send the CCR to the specified Kettle and validate its inclusion.

### Step 4: Send Backrun

In practice, this transaction would be sent by a searcher listening for hints on SUAVE, after they have received the hint emitted by the `newBid` function that the user called above, crafted a backrun based on that hint, which they want a builder to include on the original domain where the user wants to transact.

```go
    backRunBundle := &types.SBundle{
        Txs:             types.Transactions{ethTxnBackrun},
        RevertingHashes: []common.Hash{},
    }
    backRunBundleBytes, _ := json.Marshal(backRunBundle)

    confidentialDataMatchBytes, _ := bundleBidContract.Abi.Methods["fetchBidConfidentialBundleData"].Outputs.Pack(backRunBundleBytes)

    // backrun inputs
    targetBlock := uint64(1)
    allowedPeekers := []common.Address{mevShareContract.Address()}

    txnResult, err := mevShareContract.SendTransaction("newMatch", []interface{}{targetBlock + 1, allowedPeekers, []common.Address{}, bidId}, confidentialDataMatchBytes)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
```

- Create a backrun transaction bundle that will be sent after the initial bid. **This is also a Confidential Compute Request**. 
- Serialize the backrun bundle and use the MEV-Share contract's `newMatch` function to submit it.
- Verify the transaction receipt to ensure the backrun was successful.


:::info

What is not included in this script is the final step in the e2e example. We need to send this matched bundle - which includes both the original transaction from the user and the backrun from the searcher - to a builder so that it can be included in a block on the target domain. Rigil includes the ability to send such bundles to centralized relays for inclusion. There is [builder solidity code which demonstrates how this might occur here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers/bids.sol#L141).
