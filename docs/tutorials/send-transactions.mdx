:::info

Sending transactions requires that you use either the Golang or Typescript SDKs we have made available. Confidential Compute Requests (CCRs) are not EIP-1193 compatible so signing CCRs from browser wallets requires some workarounds.

:::

The [previous tutorial illustrated](/tutorials/deploy-contracts) how to deploy a series of example contracts using the Golang SDK and, in the first tutorial, you [setup SUAVE and then ran a script to "test the devnet"](/tutorials/run-suave#testing-the-devnet).

> This tutorial will reiterate how contract deployment works, **and show you how to craft the transactions** that occur in [this script](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

## MEV-Share Example

The `suave-geth` repo has an [example version of MEV-Share](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers/bundles.sol#L68). The script we'll be walking through does four things:

1. deploy the MEV-Share contract
2. sign and submit a transaction to be back run
3. grab the extracted hint from onchain
4. sign a back run transaction and submit it

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

Let's break down what this script is doing.

### Step 1: Create and Fund Test Accounts

```go
testAddr1 = generatePrivKey()
testAddr2 = generatePrivKey()

if err := fundAccount(mevmClt, testAddr1.Address(), fundBalance); err != nil {
    return err
}
fmt.Printf("- Funded test account: %s (%s)\n", testAddr1.Address().Hex(), fundBalance.String())
```

- Generate two new private keys representing test accounts.
- Fund these test accounts with a specified amount of Ether to simulate transactions.

### Step 2: Deploy MEV-Share Contract

```go
// Code snippet related to the step
txnResult, err := sdk.DeployContract(mevShareArtifact.Code, mevmClt)
```

- Deploy the MEV-Share smart contract to the SUAVE chain using the bytecode and a client instance.
- Confirm the deployment by checking the transaction receipt status.

### Step 3: Send Confidential Compute Request

In this example, the transactions in the `bundle` would be from other blockchains, and may contain MEV on those chains which the user wants to share with searchers listening for hints on SUAVE.

```go
    refundPercent := 10
    bundle := &types.SBundle{
        Txs:             types.Transactions{ethTxn1},
        RevertingHashes: []common.Hash{},
        RefundPercent:   &refundPercent,
    }
    bundleBytes, _ := json.Marshal(bundle)

    // new mevshare transaction inputs
    targetBlock := uint64(1)
    allowedPeekers := []common.Address{mevShareContract.Address()}

    confidentialDataBytes, _ := bundleContract.Abi.Methods["fetchConfidentialBundleData"].Outputs.Pack(bundleBytes)

    txnResult, err := mevShareContract.SendTransaction("newTransaction", []interface{}{targetBlock + 1, allowedPeekers, []common.Address{}}, confidentialDataBytes)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
```

- Craft a Confidential Compute Request using the MEV-Share contract function `newTransaction`.
- Serialize the bundle of transactions to include in the CCR, along with the `refundPercent` the sender of the CCR is looking for.
- Sets a `targetBlock` which is used as the `decryptionCondition`, along with the `allowedPeekers`. That is, the data in the bundle may be decrypted after a specific block (i.e the `targetBlock`) by any of the `allowedPeekers` (which, in this context, is the mevShareContract itself who needs to store the bundle and potentially match it with any backruns it receives once a hint is emitted). This is what we mean by "programmable privacy" which, in this case, is being used to ensure pre-trade privacy because the `decryptionCondition` is just a block number.
- Send the CCR to the specified Kettle and validate its inclusion.

### Step 4: Send Backrun

In practice, this transaction would be sent by a searcher listening for hints on SUAVE, after they have received the hint emitted by the `newBid` function that the user called above, crafted a backrun based on that hint, which they want a builder to include on the original domain where the user wants to transact.

```go
    backRunBundle := &types.SBundle{
        Txs:             types.Transactions{ethTxnBackrun},
        RevertingHashes: []common.Hash{},
    }
    backRunBundleBytes, _ := json.Marshal(backRunBundle)

    confidentialDataMatchBytes, _ := bundleContract.Abi.Methods["fetchConfidentialBundleData"].Outputs.Pack(backRunBundleBytes)

    // backrun inputs
    targetBlock := uint64(1)
    allowedPeekers := []common.Address{mevShareContract.Address()}

    txnResult, err := mevShareContract.SendTransaction("newMatch", []interface{}{targetBlock + 1, allowedPeekers, []common.Address{}, DataID}, confidentialDataMatchBytes)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
```

- Create a backrun transaction bundle that will be sent after the initial bid. **This is also a Confidential Compute Request**.
- Serialize the backrun bundle and use the MEV-Share contract's `newMatch` function to submit it.
- Verify the transaction receipt to ensure the backrun was successful.

:::info

What is not included in this script is the final step in the e2e example. We need to send this matched bundle - which includes both the original transaction from the user and the backrun from the searcher - to a builder so that it can be included in a block on the target domain. Rigil includes the ability to send such bundles to centralized relays for inclusion. There is [builder solidity code which demonstrates how this might occur here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers/bundles.sol#L182).
