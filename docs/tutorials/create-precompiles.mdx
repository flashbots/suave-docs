# Create Precompiles

:::info

Creating precompiles requires writing lower level code than the contracts and transactions we've been working with so far. You will need a local clone of `suave-geth` to follow this tutorial, and we'll be making changes to the core code itself.

:::

SUAVE uses [custom precompiles](/technical/specs/rigil/precompiles) to extend the EVM with specific MEV functions.

In this tutorial, we will add a new precompile to the [suave-geth client](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth) that will be accessible in any builder solidity contract on SUAVE.

## Understand the structure

We specify the inputs and outputs for each precompile in `yaml`. This automatically generates two bindings, one in Solidity (the client) and another one in Go (the server).

The Solidity binding is implemented in a [Solidity library](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/libraries/Suave.sol) that Suave apps can use to call precompiles. The [Golang counterpart](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_suave_runtime_adapter.go) runs in the EVM and handles the Solidity calls to the SUAVE precompiles.

The bindings handle encoding/decoding and error management, providing a standard format for both runtimes to communicate with each other. This removes all the nitty-gritty work required such that you can focus on creating the precompiles you need without getting caught up in the implementation complexities.

The `yaml` specification looks like this:

```yaml
types:
  - name: BidId
    type: bytes16
structs:
  - name: Bid
    fields:
      - name: id
        type: BidId
      - name: decryptionCondition
        type: uint64
---
functions:
  - name: confidentialInputs
    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000042010001'
    output:
      plain: true
      fields:
        - name: output1
          type: bytes
  - name: newBid
    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000042030000'
    input:
      - name: decryptionCondition
        type: uint64
      - name: allowedPeekers
        type: address[]
      - name: bidType
        type: string
    output:
      fields:
        - name: bid
          type: Bid
```

There are three top-level objects: `types`, `structs` and `functions`. In this guide, we will focus on the `functions`, as adding a new precompile will most often entail writing a new function.

If you can specify the function's name, the address its logic is deployed at on SUAVE, and what form you expect the inputs and output to take, then our codegen tool will automatically generate both the Solidity and Go bindings required to make your precompile work.

The fields you can include when adding a new `function` to the `yaml` specification are:

- `name`: Name of the precompile.
- `address`: Address of the precompile.
- `input`: Configuration of the expected input.
  - `name`: Name of the input field
  - `type`: Type of the input field.
- `output`: Configuration of the expected output.
  - `plain`: Boolean that specifies whether to pack the output. Only available if the function returns a single array of bytes.
  - `fields`: Array of output fields for the precompile.
    - `name`: Name of the output field
    - `type`: Type of the output field.

Input and output types can be a basic Solidity type (`address`), a composite type (`address[]`), or a reference to any of the custom types and structs (i.e. `Struct`, `Struct[]`). It must be written in the same format as it would be in Solidity.

## Add your own

Now we can write a custom SUAVE precompile to perform the "add" operation in order to illustrate how to add your own. This is a two step process:

1. Edit the `yaml` specification, adding your new precompile to the `functions` block.
2. Implement the custom logic in the Go runtime that is required to get from the inputs to the outputs you specified.

You can edit the [`yaml` specification here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/gen/suave_spec.yaml). We'll add a new entry in the `functions` section:

```yaml
functions:
  - name: add
    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000042010009'
    input:
      - name: a
        type: uint64
      - name: b
        type: uint64
    output:
      fields:
        - name: output1
          type: uint64
```

Then, run our code generator:

```bash
$ go run suave/gen/main.go --write
```

If your `yaml` additions have no errors and the `--write` flag is set, the bindings will be (re)generated [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/libraries/Suave.sol) and [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_suave_runtime_adapter.go).

A new `Add` function will have been created in the interface, which looks like:

```go
type SuaveRuntime interface {
    ...
    Add(a uint64, b uint64) (uint64, error)
    ...
}
```

You will now need to write the logic required for your precompile to work as expected based on this generated skeleton.

Adapter code will be written into [`contracts_suave_runtime_adapter.go`](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_suave_runtime_adapter.go), but you will need to add your method to [`suave_contracts.go`](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_suave.go). In our case, the logic is very simple: just a straightforward addition of the values passed in as inputs. Your implementation may be arbitrarily more complex based on what you want the precompile to achieve.

```go
func (b *suaveRuntime) Add(a uint64, b uint64) (uint64, error) {
    return a+b, nil
}
```

You can find a worked example of how to add a more complicated precompile in [this PR](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/pull/66/files).
