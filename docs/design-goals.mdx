We draw on the theoretical goals outlined in "[Strategyproof Computing](https://groups.ischool.berkeley.edu/archive/p2pecon/papers/s1-ng.pdf)": 

```
1. Incentives-first
2. Utility-based
3. Simple
4. Open
5. Decentralized
```

and the practical ones which led to the implementation of [Serenity](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/serenity_design_rationale?type=view#Principles):

```
1. Simplicity
2. Long-term stability
3. Sufficiency
4. Defense in depth
5. Full light-client verifiability
```

<GridBlock symbol="I." title="Permissionless">

It should be possible for anyone to deploy any kind of builder solidity contract. This is inspired by the "open" principle from Strategyproof computing, which states: "Our belief is that an open marketplace will naturally lead to mechanisms with the 'right scope' and 'right complexity'." 

We cannot preempt every kind of MEV that will exist, or the range of methods which can be concocted to extract and distribute it. Therefore, we aim to enable anyone, anywhere to create and deploy novel contracts in response to unpredictable needs. The public nature of these permissionless contracts should help the entire ecosystem remain proactive, as permissionless access should imply a contestable marketplace of designs.

<GridBlock symbol="II." title="Private">

The operation of mechanisms for ordering information and distributing value must be public and verifiable. The data which passes through those mechanisms need not be. Privacy is a human right and, in the context of MEV, it actually enables us to create systems that are more resilient to economic centralization over time, and to malicious manipulation in any given moment. 

We must provide people with the ability to keep their data hidden and only reveal it to those whom they trust or wish to interact with.

<GridBlock symbol="III." title="Sufficient">

This is inspired by the Serenity design rationale, which states that it should be "possible to build as many classes of applications as possible on top of the protocol". 

We strive for the same generality with SUAVE: it should be possible to use SUAVE to create any kind of application to do with order flow, block building, commitments, instantaneous privacy, and any other MEV application we have yet to imagine.

<GridBlock symbol="IV." title="Simple">

Strategyproof computing argues that we ought to "simplify the decisions facing participants in distributed multi-agent systems", and Vitalik points out that simplicity matters "because it (i) minimizes development costs, (ii) reduces risk of unforeseen security issues, and (iii) allows protocol designers to more easily convince users that parameter choices are legitimate". 

Simplicity implies flexibility with respect to dependencies, such that we can upgrade from SGX to MPC, or deploy better cryptographic solutions like FHE, or introduce some maximally robust and sufficiently decentralized combination of the above.

<GridBlock symbol="V." title="Decentralized">

It is hard to find the optimal means of allocating resources without centralizing power. Therefore, it is worth doing. We aim for systems that are robust and scalable, beyond the limitations imposed by trusted third parties.

In our ordering here, decentralization is also related to "Defense in depth", though we apply this specifically to the boundary between developing the ideal mechanisms for MEV extraction, and crafting the most powerful means for users to express commitments and privacy preferences. That is, SUAVE should work as well as possible under a variety of security assumptions which sit at the intersection of information theory, computer science, economics, and sociopolitics.

<GridBlock symbol="VI." title="Fair">

This is inspired by Strategyproof computing, which states that, "the self-interest of participants in distributed systems should be explicitly addressed by system designers, much as we currently address issues of fault-tolerance and security." 

It should be possible to quantify who benefits, and how much they benefit relative to the average.

We do not mean "who" in the personal sense, but rather in terms of the type of actors involved. Specifically, users should enjoy the majority of the value they create, with the rest of that value cascading down to those doing the most relevant work.
