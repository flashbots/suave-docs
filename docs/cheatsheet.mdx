On this page you'll find every single markdown & mdx component used in our docs

## Page Title & Data

For the title of the page, and the name of the tab, at the very top of your file, just add this code snippet to the top.

Any thing between the `---` tags will be used for the meta data of the page

```md
---
title: Cheatsheet
id: page-id-when-linking-to-it
---
```

For Heading 1 specifically, you should set the page title in the meta data.

## Text styling

_Italic/Emphasize_

```md
_Italic/Emphasize_
```

**Strong/Bold**

```md
**Strong/Bold**
```

**_Italic & Bold_**

```md
**_Italic & Bold_**
```

## Codeblocks

So you basically define a section using the ` ``` ` anything between two lines that contain these 3 back quotes will be in the block

If you want specific formatting for a certain language like for example Javascript here:

```js
const threeCats = ['cat', 'cat', 'cat'];
```

```md
Mind the indentation here, code blocks in code blocks isn't normal usage `js     const threeCats = ["cat", "cat", "cat"]     `
```

Theres a lot of different formattings to use, `md`, `js`, `ts`, etc. The package used is [Prism react render](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer)

## Links

The links in this paragraph are being pulled from a list [a link][1] and another [link][2].

```md
The links in this paragraph are being pulled from a list [a link][1] and another [link][2].
```

```md
This is that list

[1]: http://example.com/ 'Title'
[2]: http://example.org/ 'Title'
```

[1]: http://example.com/ 'Title'
[2]: http://example.org/ 'Title'

## Images

### Alt tags for images

You can update the alt tag data for text like this:

Logo: ![Alt](/img/logo.png 'Flashbots logo')

```md
Logo: ![Alt](/img/logo.png 'Flashbots logo')
```

You can create a image with a hyperlink to another page or a hash link on the page by adding the link in the brackets next to it

Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/logo.png)](https://docs.flashbots.net/ 'Off to the docs')

```md
Linked logo: [![alt text](//img/logo.png)](https://docs.flashbots.net/ 'Off to the docs')
```

## MDX features

A quick note on using what's called `.mdx` features, `mdx` means markdown extended, to used these features, you need to name your file to have the extension `.mdx`

For example `cheatsheet.mdx`

This lets you use react components that are a bit more intricate that the standard markdown features.

To make use of an `mdx` component like `Tabs`, you need to add any `import ... from ...` lines to the top of the page, but below the meta data section. Heres an example:

```
---
title: Cheatsheet (Heading 1)
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

### Tabs

This is an example of the `tabs` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/tabs)

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    {label: 'Apple', value: 'apple'},
    {label: 'Orange', value: 'orange'},
    {label: 'Banana', value: 'banana'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple üçé</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange üçä</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana üçå</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```mdx
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="apple"
  values={[
    {label: 'Apple', value: 'apple'},
    {label: 'Orange', value: 'orange'},
    {label: 'Banana', value: 'banana'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="apple">This is an apple üçé</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange">This is an orange üçä</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana">This is a banana üçå</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Inline Table of Contents

If you need a table contents literally anywhere, you can make use of the `<TOCInline>` component.

For extend usage, please refer to the [Docusaurus documentation.](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/inline-toc)

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

```mdx
import TOCInline from '@theme/TOCInline';

<TOCInline toc={toc} />
```

## Footnotes & references

This is how we make a reference to a foot note or reference that's found at the bottoms of the page.[^1]

```md
This is how we make a reference to a footnote [^1] that's found at the bottoms of the page
```

To create list of foot notes, you just add list like this somewhere, preferably at the bottom of the file

```md
[^1]: an amazing foot note, you can add links n things here as usual
```

## Docusaurus-specific considerations

There's a couple things to be aware of when adding your own `*.md` files to our codebase:

- Please remove all `HTML` elements
- Links are done using `[text](link)` this can link out to external links or to local docs files
- For images, use the syntax `![Alt Text](image url)` to add an image, alternatively see below:

```md
<img src={require('../static/img/example-banner.png').default} alt="Example banner" />
```

### Adding meta data to your doc

The docs make use of a feature called [frontmatter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter) which lets you add some meta data and control the way the docs are referenced through the site.

This is done by adding a small section to the top of your doc like this:

```md
---
title: Example Doc
---
```

That title in the example will automatically add a `# Heading` to your page when it renders

There are a couple settings available;

Such as specifying the url you would like using

`slug: /questionably/deep/url/for/no/reason/buckwheat-crepes`

Adding `keywords` or `description` etc, below is a full example:

```
---
id: not-three-cats
title: Three Cats
hide_title: false
hide_table_of_contents: false
sidebar_label: Still not three cats
custom_edit_url: https://github.com/flashbots/docs/edit/main/docs/three-cats.md
description: Three cats are not unlike four cats like three cats
keywords:
  - cats
  - three
image: ./assets/img/logo.png
slug: /myDoc
---
My Document Markdown content
```

### Side bar navigation

To update the high level navigation, open the file in `docs/sidebars.js` and arrange n order as required. The titles for links are pulled from their files.

The `items` here take a page ID, a page ID by default is the title of the file, as example `example-doc.md` would be `example-doc`
