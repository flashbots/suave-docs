# Welcome to SUAVE

If MEV only benefits the few, we cannot realise the permissionless, censorship-resistant systems that crypto promises.

SUAVE unifies how we coordinate without forcing any one mechanism onto everyone. SUAVE does not replace other blockchains: it is intended to aggregate and coordinate all the things that ultimately change the state of other chains.

SUAVE is a permissionless and open marketplace for many mechanisms. SUAVE enables anyone to innovate, design, and deploy different applications that mitigate MEV on any other blockchain. Such "MEV applications" can provide a sustainable [defender's advantage](https://vitalik.ca/general/2016/12/29/pos_design.html) against centralizing economic forces both within and beyond crypto.  

Reducing the economic centralization pressure on other blockchains enables:

  to decentralize their work and access more orderflow

  <GridBlock symbol="III." title="Validators">
  to participate on a level playing field across domains
  </GridBlock>
  <GridBlock symbol="IV." title="Humans">
  to transact fairly, with the best execution.
  </GridBlock>
</Grid>

SUAVE is _unifying infrastructure_ in which the incentives for all actors in the transaction supply chain are aligned around shared ownership, rather than private economies of scale.

We must make sure block building - and the power it implies - ends up meaningfully decentralized, because decentralization is a means towards the end where crypto helps us realise permissionless, censorship-resistant, and verifiable public systems which are genuinely good for the communities who use them.

## About this site

This site encourages you to move through a specific flow in order to start building the _future of coordination_. 

1. Begin with **[tutorials](/tutorials/index)**. These are _learning-oriented_. They focus on practical skills, not theoretical knowledge. Our goal with the tutorials is that you enjoy the experience and gain confidence, not that you become an expert.
2. Grow with the **[how to guides](/how-to/index)**. These are _task-oriented_. You can think of them like recipes. Following a recipe requires basic competence. Recipes do not give you context or history: they will help you do stuff. All the recipes taken together help frame a general picture of how SUAVE enables you.
3. Consult the **[technical details](/technical-details/index)**. These are _information-oriented_ and provide you with up-to-date certainty about what interfaces and precompiles SUAVE provides and where to find them. These are our treasure maps, which tell you what you need to know about the territory you're working in, without having to go and constantly check yourself.
4. Refine your **[understanding of MEV](/understand/index)**. This section is _discussion-oriented_. It does not present "the right way", but rather encourages you to reflect on "the deep why", ideally in dialogue with friends. Why does it matter that we work on MEV?

## Unified, decentralized

After [formalizing the threat posed by MEV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), and creating [MEV-Geth](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth) to begin addressing it, [Flashbots](https://medium.com/flashbots/frontrunning-the-mev-crisis-40629a613752ï»¿) has collaborated with many people and organizations to build neutral, open-source software like [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) and protocols like [MEV-Share](https://github.com/flashbots/MEV-Share). Our work has prevented the worst effects of MEV, though many problems remain.

SUAVE is our means of _keeping block building decentralized_ by creating an _open marketplace for mechanisms_ for any kind of MEV application, which require one (or many) of the following:

1. **private data**, e.g., auctions, block building
2. **coordination within block times**, e.g., block building, trade routing and filling
3. **access to fresh off-chain data**, e.g., trading strategies conditional on centralized exchange prices or transactions that are conditional on other transactions
4. **commitments** of various kinds, e.g., shared sequencers for rollups, new kinds of DEXes and bridges
5. **too much gas to do on-chain** because of how much compute they use.

Any mechanism that strikes a meaningful balance between revenue optimality and efficiency will have broad application, and SUAVE is a unified venue for many such applications. As such, SUAVE exhibits second-order effects. For instance, keeping block building decentralized by creating an open marketplace for mechanisms results in SUAVE also being a shared sequencing layer for other blockchains. We expect that SUAVE will find increasingly wider application as more people build better mechanisms with it.

## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV. We achieve this in three ways: _Illuminate the Dark Forest_, _Democratize Extraction_, and _Distribute Benefits_.

- _Research_: open, transparent, and collaborative research to tackle short and long term research questions relevant to MEV.
- _Product_: engineering products to fulfill our mission.
- _Coordination_: organizing processes, interfacing with external teams in the ecosystem, and maximizing our impact.

You can interact with Flashbots on our [Discourse forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/) or in [Discord](https://discord.gg/7hvTycdNcK). Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each [Github repository](https://github.com/flashbots/).
