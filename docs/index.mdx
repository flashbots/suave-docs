# Start Building on SUAVE

Welcome to our first internal SUAVE hackathon. Let's start building better mechanisms.

There are two broad categories of work you can get involved with: creating precompiles and/or designing and implementing contracts for specific SUAPPs.

It's likely that you will want to start by [runnning SUAVE locally](/how-to/run-suave) for both of these. 

Alternatively, you can [transact or deploy a contract directly on the Rigil Testnet](/how-to/send-transactions#3-use-rigil-testnet-rpc).

If you're not sure what to hack on, please read through our [ideas about what to build](/novel-use-cases) to get some inspiration.

## Important Terms 

Here are all the key terms you'll find in these docs. The names and descriptions will evolve as the software does.

| Term | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| SUAPP | SUAVE application. For now, a smart contract that uses SUAVE precompiles. Frontend optional. |
| Rigil Testnet | The current test network. Naming convention follows the stars in the Alpha Centauri system. |
| Kettle | The main logical actor in the SUAVE protocol. We don't call it a "node" because it's at least two nodes (and some other services) in a trenchcoat. |
| MEVM | Modified EVM, where the modifications specifically enable credible offchain computation. |
| Precompile | A convenient way to enable direct execution of predefined functions in the EVM, meant to enable more interesting SUAPPs. |
| Confidential Compute Request (CCR) | The initial object users send to a Kettle, via an RPC. Made up of an ordinary transaction + confidential inputs + pubkey of Kettle(s) that can decrypt it. |
| SUAVE transaction | The transaction object that is broadcast on the SUAVE Chain. Contains the result of a CCR in its calldata + the signature of the Kettle(s) which computed said result. |
| SUAVE Chain | A fork of Ethereum, currently running Clique PoA consensus for rapid iteration. Main purpose is to reach (and maintain) consensus about smart contract code. |
| Confidential Data Store | A secure and privacy-focused key-value storage system. | 
| Bid | An artefact from early development, which is now just a Data Identifier used when operating on confidential data. For instance, a SUAVE transaction can emit logs on chain which reference the `bidId` from a CCR without revealing the confidential inputs to that CCR. |
