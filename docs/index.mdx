# Welcome to SUAVE

If MEV only benefits the few, we cannot realize the permissionless, censorship-resistant systems that crypto promises.

SUAVE is a permissionless and open marketplace for mechanisms. SUAVE enables anyone to innovate, design, and deploy different applications that mitigate issues caused by MEV on any other blockchain. Such "SUAPPs" can provide rich incentives that help us steer clear of the centralizing economic forces both within and beyond crypto.  

Reducing the economic centralization pressure on other blockchains enables:

<Grid>
  <GridBlock symbol="I." title="System designers">
  to decentralize power, not just architecture
  </GridBlock>
  <GridBlock symbol="II." title="Block builders">
  to decentralize infra, accessing more orderflow
  </GridBlock>
  <GridBlock symbol="III." title="Validators">
  to maximise revenue in a constructive way
  </GridBlock>
  <GridBlock symbol="IV." title="People">
  to transact fairly, with the best execution
  </GridBlock>
</Grid>

SUAVE is _unifying infrastructure_ in which the incentives for all actors in the transaction supply network are aligned around shared ownership, rather than private economies of scale.

## About this site

This site encourages you to move through a specific flow in order to start building the _future of coordination_. 

1. Begin with **[tutorials](/)**. These are _learning-oriented_. They focus on practical skills, not theoretical knowledge. Our goal here is that you enjoy the experience and gain confidence, not that you become an expert.
2. Grow with the **[how to guides](/how-to/)**. These are _task-oriented_. You can think of them like recipes. Recipes do not give you context or history: they will help you do stuff.
3. Consult the **[technical specs](/technical/)**. These are _information-oriented_ and provide you with up-to-date certainty about the software we provide. They are our treasure maps.
4. Refine your **[understanding of MEV](/understand/)**. This section is _discussion-oriented_. It does not present "the right way", but rather encourages you to reflect on "the deep why", ideally in dialogue with friends. Why does it matter that we work on MEV?
