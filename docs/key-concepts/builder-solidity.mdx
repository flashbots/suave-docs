# Builder Solidity

Builder solidity is a superset of Solidity with additional precompiles to support decentralized MEV applications. It looks something like this [[ðŸ”— source](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers/bids.sol)]:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

import "../libraries/Suave.sol";

contract AnyBidContract {

	event BidEvent(
		Suave.BidId bidId,
		uint64 decryptionCondition,
		address[] allowedPeekers
	);

	function fetchBidConfidentialBundleData() public returns (bytes memory) {
		require(Suave.isConfidential());
		
		bytes memory confidentialInputs = Suave.confidentialInputs();
		return abi.decode(confidentialInputs, (bytes));
	}

	function emitBid(Suave.Bid calldata bid) public {
		emit BidEvent(bid.id, bid.decryptionCondition, bid.allowedPeekers);
	}
}
```

Builder solidity contracts are used to define the public logic that is used for confidential computation. Using a precompile like `confidentialInputs` allows [SUAVE computors](/technical/specs/rigil/computor) to access encrypted data from users, do stuff with it privately and only reveal the results, not the inputs. 

This ensures confidentiality **and** improves efficiency, enabling computation that is not possible on blockchains like Ethereum.

To get your hands on working examples of builder solidity contracts, we recommend our [how to write a contract guide](/how-to/write-a-contract).

## Confidential Computation

**TODO:**

1. Explain view functions and how we use those for execution of `confidentialComputeRequests`
2. An example of a very simple request and response object on a view function to show how it all works with data points
3. A more in-depth data flow

## Further context

We recommend [this early research talk from Andrew Miller](https://youtu.be/DhsDFKnHPa0?t=344) to get a sense of the ideas from which builder solidity has grown.

Please note that the pseudo code Andrew shows is now outdated and you are better off learning from our [how to write a contract guide](/how-to/write-a-contract) above, or looking directly at our [list of available precompiles](/technical/specs/rigil/precompiles). That said, the framework used in this talk and the background provided should still prove useful when writing your own builder solidity contracts.
