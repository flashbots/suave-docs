# Precompiles

Below, you will find a list of currently available precompiles in the MEVM, for use when writing expressive, confidential smart contracts. The idea of extending the EVM with new precompiles for specific use cases is not new. We take inspiration from many other projects, including Secret Network and Oasis Protocol.

While it is possible to call the SUAVE precompiles directly using, for example, `abi.encode` and `abi.decode` in Solidity, we recommend using the [convenient Suave.sol library](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/libraries/Suave.sol) we have created for a more comfortable experience.


```solidity
function isConfidential() internal view returns (bool b)
function confidentialInputs() internal view returns (bytes memory)
function newBid(uint64 decryptionCondition, address[] memory allowedPeekers, string memory BidType) internal view returns (Bid memory)
function fetchBids(uint64 cond, string memory namespace) internal view returns (Bid[] memory)
function confidentialStoreSet(BidId bidId, string memory key, bytes memory data) internal view
function confidentialStoreGet(BidId bidId, string memory key) internal view returns (bytes memory)
function simulateBundle(bytes memory bundleData) internal view returns (bool, uint64)
function extractHint(bytes memory bundleData) internal view returns (bytes memory)
function buildEthBlock(BuildBlockArgs memory blockArgs, BidId bid, string memory namespace) internal view returns (bytes memory, bytes memory)
function submitEthBlockBidToRelay(string memory relayUrl, bytes memory builderBid) internal view returns (bool, bytes memory)
```

## Example usage

This builder solidity contract begins by importing the [Suave.sol library](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sol/libraries/Suave.sol) and demonstrates the usage of the first two precompiles in the list above, `isOffchain` and `confidentialInputs`:


```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

import "../libraries/Suave.sol";

contract FetchAndEmit {

  event BidEvent(
		Suave.BidId bidId,
		uint64 decryptionCondition,
		address[] allowedPeekers
	);

	function fetchBidConfidentialBundleData() public returns (bytes memory) {
		require(Suave.isOffchain());
		
		bytes memory confidentialInputs = Suave.confidentialInputs();
		return abi.decode(confidentialInputs, (bytes));
	}

	function emitBid(Suave.Bid calldata bid) public {
		emit BidEvent(bid.id, bid.decryptionCondition, bid.allowedPeekers);
	}

}
```

Please check our [how to write builder solidity guide](/how-to/write-builder-solidity) for more ideas about how to leverage all the precompiles available.

Once you are familiar with what is currently on offer, we invite you to [look at the implementation](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/core/vm/contracts_suave.go) and help us extend what is available.

We will be happy to help you get a specific precompile you need for your MEV use case into the MEVM.

## Exact Details

If you'd like to call the precompiles directly, you can use the addresses and details listed below to do so without having to import the whole `Suave.sol` library.

### isConfidential

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42010000` |
| Inputs | None |
| Outputs | boolean |

Outputs whether execution mode is regular (on-chain) or confidential.

**NOTE**: this is the only precompile available during on-chain execution, where it simply returns false.

### ConfidentialInputs

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42010001` |
| Inputs | None |
| Outputs | bytes |

Outputs the confidential inputs passed in with the confidential computation request.

**NOTE**: currently all precompiles have access to the data passed in. This might change in the future.

### ConfidentialStoreSet

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42020000` |
| Inputs | (Suave.BidId bidId, string key, bytes data) |
| Outputs | None |

Stores the value in underlying confidential store. 

Requires that the caller is present in the `AllowedPeekers` of the bid passed in.

### ConfidentialStoreGet

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42020001` |
| Inputs | (Suave.BidId bidId, string key) |
| Outputs | bytes |

Retrieves the value from underlying confidential store.

Requires that the caller is present in the `AllowedPeekers` of the bid passed in.

### NewBid

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42030000` |
| Inputs | (uint64 decryptionCondition, string[] allowedPeekers) |
| Outputs | Suave.Bid |

Initializes the bid in ConfidentialStore. All bids must be initialized before attempting to store data on them.

Initialization of bids can *only* be done through this precompile.

### FetchBids

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42030001` |
| Inputs | uint64 DecryptionCondition |
| Outputs | Suave.Bid[] |

Returns all bids matching the decryption condition.

In the near future bids will be stored in a different way, possibly changing how they are accessed.

### SimulateBundle

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42100000` |
| Inputs | bytes bundleArgs (json) |
| Outputs | (bool success, uint64 egp) |

Simulates the bundle by building a block containing it, returns whether the apply was successful and the EGP of the resulting block.

### ExtractHint

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42100037` |
| Inputs | bytes bundleData (json) |
| Outputs | bytes hintData (json) |

Parses the bundle data and extracts the hint: i.e. the "to" address and the calldata.

The return structure is encoded as follows:

```go
struct {
    To   common.Address
    Data []byte
}
```

### BuildEthBlock

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42100001` |
| Inputs | (Suave.BuildBlockArgs blockArgs, Suave.BidId bidId) |
| Outputs | (bytes builderBid, bytes blockPayload) |

Builds an Ethereum block based on the bid passed in.

The bid can either hold `ethBundle` in its confidential store, or be a "merged bid", i.e. contain a list of bids in `mergedBids` in its confidential store. The merged bids should themselves hold `ethBundle`.

The block is built *in order*, without any attepmts at re-ordering. The block will contain the transactions unless they failed to apply. The caller should check whether the bids applied successfully, ie whether they revert only if are allowed to.

### SubmitEthBlockBidToRelay

|   |   |
|---|---|
| Address | `0x42100002` |
| Inputs | (string relayUrl, bytes builderBid (json) |
| Outputs | (bytes error) |

Submits provided builderBid to a boost relay. If the submission is successful, returns nothing, otherwise returns an error string.
