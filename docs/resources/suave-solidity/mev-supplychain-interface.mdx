title: MEV Supplychain Interface
description: test
---

SUAVE and the precompiles it exposes allows you to interact with whatever component in the MEV supplychain your SUAPP needs to.

The mev supply chain looks like xyz. (maybe insert linear supplychain photo?)

SUAPPs can interact with any of these components!

### Off-SUAVE interaction

```solidity
    function submitBundleJsonRPC(string memory url, string memory method, bytes memory params) internal view returns (bytes memory)
    function submitEthBlockToRelay(string memory relayUrl, bytes memory builderBid) internal view returns (bytes memory)
    function doHTTPRequest(HttpRequest memory request) internal view returns (bytes memory)
```
- explain how you can create bundles and send them to a centralized block builder
- explain how you can create blocks and send them to a centralized relay
- explain how we have an arbitrary http request precompile so you can even send them to arbitrary offchain services or even make queries to offchain APIs.

### On SUAVE interaction

The main way to interact with other components on SUAVE is through the confidential data store. 

```solidity
    function confidentialStore(DataId dataId, string memory key, bytes memory value) internal view
    function confidentialRetrieve(DataId dataId, string memory key) internal view returns (bytes memory)
```



### mev supply network

something about programmable interaction between components allowing for full programmatic control across the entire supply chain (maybe insert graph supplychain photo from frontier research? good meme)
