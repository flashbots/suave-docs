Confidential computation is a key primitive in handling orderflow privately and securely. 

## Confidential Compute Requests

From suave-spec

"Starting Point: The process initiates with a "Confidential Compute Request" directed towards the JsonRPC.

MEVM Execution: Upon receiving the request, the Json RPC triggers the MEVM (Modified Ethereum Virtual Machine) to run. MEVM execution can use multiple APIs depending on the context, with two possible paths:

Request to an External Domain: The MEVM can make API requests to external domains via Domain-Specific Services.
Request to the Confidential Datastore: The MEVM can make API requests directly to the "Confidential Datastore" to fetch or store data.
Suave Chain Interaction: Eventually, after processing the request, depending on the SUAPP, the MEVM takes the results and sends a SUAVE transaction.

Transaction Hash Output: Following the Suave transaction, a transaction hash is produced and returned to the request's originator, precisely like in the Ethereum process."

### Restricting Callbacks to Confidential Compute

"When u intialise the contract you pass it a secret key which is stored in confidential storage. This key with the local nonce is used to derive the next secret.

Hash of the present secret is in public(evm) storage.

Whenever restricted method is accessed the present secret needs to be provided - which is only accessable through confidential execution.
