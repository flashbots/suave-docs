## Developer Tools

1. [SUAVE Playground](https://github.com/halo3mic/suave-playground) by [Miha](https://twitter.com/MihaLotric). This repository serves as a guide for setting up a local environment to build and submit Goerli blocks to Flashbots's relay using Suave.
2. [SUAVE Foundry Template](https://github.com/mehranhydary/suave-template) by [Mehran](https://twitter.com/mehranhydary) is an alternate approach to using Foundry than you'll find in the SUAPP Examples repo.

## Applications

1. [Arena X on SUAVE](https://github.com/mehranhydary/arena-suave) by [Mehran](https://twitter.com/mehranhydary/status/1727849740333703310). This is a MEV application that takes orders from users on any chain, lets searchers execute user orders on any chain, and then returns the outputs to the user. Use Arena X to trade any token and be safe from MEV.
