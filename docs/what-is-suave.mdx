# What is SUAVE?

SUAVE - the *Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression* - is a platform for building better mechanisms (such as OFAs and block builders) in a decentralized and private way. 

SUAVE does not replace other blockchains: it is intended to aggregate and coordinate all the things that ultimately change the state of other chains.

## Unified, decentralized

After [formalizing the threat posed by MEV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), and creating [MEV-Geth](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth) to begin addressing it, [Flashbots](https://medium.com/flashbots/frontrunning-the-mev-crisis-40629a613752ï»¿) has collaborated with many people and organizations to build neutral, open-source software like [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) and protocols like [MEV-Share](https://github.com/flashbots/MEV-Share). Our work has prevented the worst effects of MEV, though many problems remain.

SUAVE is our means of _keeping block building decentralized_ by creating an _open marketplace for mechanisms_, which we call "SUAPPs". A SUAPP is an application deployed on SUAVE which requires one (or many) of the following:

1. **private data**, e.g., auctions, block building
2. **coordination within block times**, e.g., block building, trade routing and filling
3. **access to fresh off-chain data**, e.g., trading strategies conditional on centralized exchange prices or transactions that are conditional on other transactions
4. **commitments** of various kinds, e.g., shared sequencers for rollups, new kinds of DEXes and bridges
5. **too much gas to do on-chain** because of how much compute they use.

Any SUAPP that strikes a meaningful balance between revenue optimality and efficiency will have broad application. SUAVE is a blockchain for many such applications and so exhibits second-order effects. For instance, keeping block building decentralized by creating an open marketplace for mechanisms could result in SUAVE being an effective, unified sequencing layer for other blockchains. 

We expect that SUAVE will find increasingly wider application as more people build better mechanisms with it.

## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV. We achieve this in three ways: _Illuminate the Dark Forest_, _Democratize Extraction_, and _Distribute Benefits_.
