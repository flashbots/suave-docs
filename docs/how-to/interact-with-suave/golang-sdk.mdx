[suave-geth provides an SDK](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/tree/main/suave/sdk) with a set of tools to interact with SUAVE, including deploying contracts, sending transactions, and waiting for transaction receipts.

## Installation

Make sure you have Go installed on your system and your workspace is set. Then import the SDK package into your Go project:

```go
import "github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/suave/sdk"
```

## Usage

### Creating a Client

To start interacting with Ethereum smart contracts, instantiate a new client:

```go
client := sdk.NewClient(rpcClient, privateKey, executionNodeAddress)
```

- `rpcClient`: Your Ethereum RPC client.
- `privateKey`: An ECDSA private key for signing transactions.
- `executionNodeAddress`: The address of a SUAVE Kettle. Use `0x03493869959c866713c33669ca118e774a30a0e5` if working on Rigil.

One way to instantiate a golang RPC client using the go-ethereum rpc module "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc" is:

```go
exNodeNetAddr = "http://localhost:8545"
rpcClient, _ := rpc.Dial(exNodeNetAddr)
```

### Deploying a Contract

Deploy a smart contract to the network:

```go
transactionResult, err := sdk.DeployContract(bytecode, client)
```

- `bytecode`: The compiled bytecode of the smart contract.
- `client`: An instance of your `Client`.


### Sending a Transaction

Interact with a contract by sending a transaction:

```go
transactionResult, err := contract.SendTransaction(methodName, args, confidentialData)
```

- `methodName`: The name of the contract method to call.
- `args`: Arguments for the method call.
- `confidentialData`: Confidential data bytes for the transaction.

### Transaction Result

After sending a transaction, you can query the result and receipt:

```go
receipt, err := transactionResult.Wait()
```

Wait for the transaction to be mined and get the receipt.

```go
hash := transactionResult.Hash()
```

Retrieve the hash of the transaction.

## Client Methods

The following are key methods available on the `Client` type:

- `RPC()`: Retrieves the underlying RPC client.
- `SignTxn(*types.LegacyTx)`: Signs a transaction with the provided private key.
- `SendTransaction(*types.LegacyTx)`: Sends a signed transaction to the network.
