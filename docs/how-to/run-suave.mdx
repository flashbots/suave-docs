# Run SUAVE Locally

Our goal in this guide is to get SUAVE running locally. This should take four commands.

You can read more about exactly what you'll be running in the [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).

## Docker

### What you need

1. Install and start Docker. You can find general directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    1. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, we recommend [this specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too. The should just happen when you install Docker.
    1. Check with `docker-compose version` (Docker Engine) or `docker compose version` (Docker Desktop).
3. We do not have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements. This section should work on most consumer laptops.

### What to do

1. Clone suave-geth:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```
2. Get to the right place in the repo:
```bash
cd suave-geth/
```
3. Run SUAVE (depending on your docker setup, you may need to run this as `sudo`):
```bash
make devnet-up 
```

### Optional testing

4. Test your node by deploying a contract and sending it some transactions:
```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```
You should see something like the below printed to your terminal (addresses, txns, and ids will differ):
```bash
suave-geth$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
Step 0: Create and fund test accounts
- Funded test account: 0x66d5a8D6B34329c0639071275b3d78D29e11EbC6 (100000000)
Step 1: Deploy mev-share contract
- Mev share contract deployed: 0x8f21Fdd6B4f4CacD33151777A46c122797c8BF17
Step 2: Send bid
- Bid sent at txn: 0xb49debcdead2b306d6ab6282b88fdad7c8d6a33d87df34b79f56d141eae7c08a
- Bid id: 30bbc65298f24e67aaf5c95bf5f0686c
Step 3: Send backrun
- Backrun sent at txn: 0xcf7880e61e94aaab48c60655c321716ecab6edab752586448b0412e93a969889
- Backrun bid id: db98b83d02694fc2b13c042ad22c233
```

> If you'd like to examine the Go code responsible for deploying contracts and sending transactions, you can do so [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

5. You can stop your docker containers with:
```bash
make devnet-down
```

### Common problems

<details>
  <summary>1. Docker not running</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Make sure that Docker is running. On most Linux machines, you can do this with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl start docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        You can check the current status with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl status docker
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>

  <summary>2. Unsupported version</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        If you're running an older version of Docker, you may get a message that looks like this:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        ERROR: Version in "././suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" is unsupported.
        </code><br/><br/>
        Simply go to the file in <code>/suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml</code> and change the first line to use <code>3.3</code> rather than <code>3.8</code>.

## Build it yourself

f you'd like to run the suave-geth binaries yourself, read on.

### What you need

1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### What to do

1. Clone the repo and build SUAVE:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
make suave
```
2. Run the MEVM first:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --datadir suave --http --ws \
--allow-insecure-unlock --unlock "0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f" \
--keystore ./suave/devenv/suave-ex-node/keystore/
```
3. Press `Enter` when prompted for a password
4. In a new terminal, run SUAVE-enabled geth:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --http --http.port 8555 --ws --ws.port 8556 \
--authrpc.port 8561
```

### What to do next

Now run:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

The output should be roughly similar to the one printed above, though addresses, txns, and ids will differ.

You can also run any familiar Geth command you like. Start by generating a new account (in another terminal):

```bash
./build/bin/suave --suave account new
```

If the `--datadir` flag is not set, a geth client stores data in the `$HOME/.ethereum` directory. Depending on the chain you use, it creates a subdirectory. For example, if you run Sepolia, geth creates `$HOME/.ethereum/sepolia/`. So, if you use the `--suave` flag, your data ends up in `$HOME/.ethereum/suave/...`.

#### Using the console 

You can attach to the usual Geth javascript console to get any interactive data you need with:

```bash
./build/bin/suave attach ./suave/geth.ipc
```

From within the console, you can run:

```bash
eth.accounts[0]
```

Which should return `"0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f"` which is the account we unlocked when starting the MEVM.

```bash
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
```

Should return a really large number `1.1579...e+77`. If you try `eth.getBalance("<your_new_address>")` instead, you should see `0`.

If you try:

```bash
web3.eth.blockNumber
```

It should tell you the block height of your local network.
