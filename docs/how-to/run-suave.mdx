# Run SUAVE Locally

Our goal in this guide is to get SUAVE running locally.

You can read more about exactly what you'll be running in the [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).

## Docker

### What you need

1. Install and start Docker. You can find general directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    1. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, we recommend [this specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too. The should just happen when you install Docker.
    1. Check with `docker-compose version` (Docker Engine) or `docker compose version` (Docker Desktop).
3. We do not have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements. This section should work on most consumer laptops.

### What to do

1. Clone suave-geth:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```
2. Get to the right place in the repo:
```bash
cd suave-geth/
```
3. Run SUAVE:
```bash
make devnet-up
```

        It is likely best to create a new user group for Docker, rather than run the above command as <code>sudo</code>. You can do by running:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        </code><br/>
        <code>
        newgrp docker
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>


### Optional testing

4. Test your node by deploying a contract and sending it some transactions:
```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```
You should see something like the below printed to your terminal (addresses, txns, and ids will differ):
```bash
suave-geth$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
Step 0: Create and fund test accounts
- Funded test account: 0x66d5a8D6B34329c0639071275b3d78D29e11EbC6 (100000000)
Step 1: Deploy mev-share contract
- Mev share contract deployed: 0x8f21Fdd6B4f4CacD33151777A46c122797c8BF17
Step 2: Send bid
- Bid sent at txn: 0xb49debcdead2b306d6ab6282b88fdad7c8d6a33d87df34b79f56d141eae7c08a
- Bid id: 30bbc65298f24e67aaf5c95bf5f0686c
Step 3: Send backrun
- Backrun sent at txn: 0xcf7880e61e94aaab48c60655c321716ecab6edab752586448b0412e93a969889
- Backrun bid id: db98b83d02694fc2b13c042ad22c233
```

If you'd like to examine the Go code responsible for deploying contracts and sending transactions, you can do so [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

5. You can stop your docker containers with:
```bash
make devnet-down
```

        If you are seeing:<br/>
        <code>
        "cp: cannot create regular file '/bin/suave': Permission denied"
        </code><br/><br/>
        it is most likely because you have not set your GOPATH correctly. You can do so by running:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        export GOPATH=$HOME/go
        </code>

        If you have set up a new machine to run through this, you'll also need to install Make and Go:<br/>

        Make sure that Docker is running. On most Linux machines, you can do this with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl start docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        You can check the current status with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl status docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        If you installed Docker and still run into issues wit docker-compose, you can try:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo apt install docker-compose
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>

  <summary>3. Unsupported version</summary>

        If you're running an older version of Docker, you may get a message that looks like this:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        ERROR: Version in "././suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" is unsupported.
        </code><br/><br/>
        Go to the file in <code>/suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml</code> and change the first line to use <code>3.3</code> rather than <code>3.8</code>.
      </div>

## Build it yourself

If you'd like to run the suave-geth binaries yourself, read on.

### What you need

1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### What to do

1. Clone the repo and build SUAVE:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
make suave
```
2. Run this command:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --suave.dev
```

### What to do next

In another terminal, you can run:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

The output should be roughly similar to the one printed above (addresses, txns, and ids will differ).

You can also run any familiar Geth command you like. Start by generating a new account:

```bash
./build/bin/suave --suave account new
```

If the `--datadir` flag is not set, a geth client stores data in the `$HOME/.ethereum` directory. Depending on the chain you use, it creates a subdirectory. For example, if you run Sepolia, geth creates `$HOME/.ethereum/sepolia/`. So, if you use the `--suave` flag, your data ends up in `$HOME/.ethereum/suave/...`.

#### Using the console

You can attach to the usual Geth javascript console to get any interactive data you need with:

```bash
./build/bin/suave attach /tmp/geth.ipc
```

From within the console, you can run:

```bash
eth.accounts[0]
```

Which should return `"0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f"` which is the account we unlocked when starting the MEVM.

```bash
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
```

Should return a really large number `1.1579...e+77`. If you try `eth.getBalance("<your_new_address>")` instead, you should see `0`.

If you try:

```bash
web3.eth.blockNumber
```

It should tell you the block height of your local network.
