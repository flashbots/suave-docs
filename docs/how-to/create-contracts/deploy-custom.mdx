# Deploy a custom contract

This sub-section of guides will walk you through creating and deploying increasingly complex smart contracts.

We'll begin with a simple contract that illustrates how to use confidential inputs. 

This focus of this first guide **how to to deploy custom contracts**. The following guides will provide more details about precompiles, the programming model, and the data flows we expect to see in SUAVE.

## 1. Write the contract

We have a number of example contracts already written in [`suave/sol/standard_peekers`](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/tree/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers) to give you inspiration.

Create a new file in that directory called `test.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

import "../libraries/Suave.sol";

contract onlyConfidential {

	event SimResultEvent(
		uint64 egp
	);

	function fetchBidConfidentialBundleData() public returns (bytes memory) {
		require(Suave.isConfidential());
		
		bytes memory confidentialInputs = Suave.confidentialInputs();
		return abi.decode(confidentialInputs, (bytes));
	}


	// note: because of confidential execution, 
    // you will not see your input as input to the function
	function helloWorld() external view {
		// 0. ensure confidential execution
		require(Suave.isConfidential());

		// 1. fetch bundle data
		bytes memory bundleData = this.fetchBidConfidentialBundleData();

		// 2. sim bundle and get effective gas price
		uint64 effectiveGasPrice = Suave.simulateBundle(bundleData);

		emit SimResultEvent(effectiveGasPrice);

		// note: this function doesn't return anything 
        // so this computation result will never land onchain
	}
}
```

This contract uses three new [precompiles](/technical/specs/rigil/mevm#precompiles): 

1. `isConfidential` to ensure that only the MEVM(s) specified by the user can fetch the confidential data in transactions to this contract.
2. `confidentialInputs` to fetch the confidential data that was submitted along with the transaction that the user sent which specified this contract.
3. `simulateBundle` for no specific reason here other than to illustrate what you, as a contract creator, might want any MEVM allowed to see confidential data to do once they have fetched it.

## 2. Deploy locally

There are currently 3 steps required to deploy a custom contract. This will change!

1. Use Remix or your other favourite tool to generate the abi and bytecode, then paste this into the `suave/artifacts` folder.
2. Extend the `suave/e2e/contracts.go` file with the name and location of your contract, ABI, and bytecode.
3. Edit the [contract deployment code](/how-to/send-transactions#2-deploy-a-contract) from the previous guide.

Using the contract above as an example, create a new folder called `test.sol` in the `suave/artifacts` directory. Create a file in you new folder called `onlyConfidential.json` and structure it like this:

```json
{
    "abi": ["<copy_from_remix>"],
    "deployedBytecode": "<copy_from_remix>",
    "bytecode": "<same_as_deployedBytecode>"
}
```

Extend `suave/e2e/contracts.go` by adding to the `var` block which declares all the contracts:

```go
OnlyConfidentialContract  = newArtifact("test.sol/onlyConfidential.json")
```

> **Make sure to capitalize `OnlyConfidentialContract` so that it is exported from this file.**

Edit [`suave/devenv/cmd/deploy.go`](/how-to/send-transactions#2-deploy-a-contract) from the previous guide to look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/ecdsa"
	"fmt"

	_ "embed"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/suave/e2e"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/suave/sdk"
)

var (
	exNodeEthAddr = common.HexToAddress("b5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f")
	exNodeNetAddr = "http://localhost:8545"
	fundedAccount = newPrivKeyFromHex("91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12")
)

var (
	onlyConfidentialArtifact = e2e.OnlyConfidentialContract
)

func main() {
    rpcClient, _ := rpc.Dial(exNodeNetAddr)
	mevmClt := sdk.NewClient(rpcClient, fundedAccount.priv, exNodeEthAddr)

	var onlyConfidentialContract *sdk.Contract
	_ = onlyConfidentialContract

	txnResult, err := sdk.DeployContract(onlyConfidentialArtifact.Code, mevmClt)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to deploy contract: %v", err)
	}
	receipt, err := txnResult.Wait()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to wait for transaction result: %v", err)
	}
	if receipt.Status == 0 {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to deploy contract: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("- Example contract deployed: %s\n", receipt.ContractAddress)
	onlyConfidentialContract = sdk.GetContract(receipt.ContractAddress, onlyConfidentialArtifact.Abi, mevmClt)
}

// Helpers, not unique to SUAVE

type privKey struct {
	priv *ecdsa.PrivateKey
}

func newPrivKeyFromHex(hex string) *privKey {
	key, err := crypto.HexToECDSA(hex)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to parse private key: %v", err))
	}
	return &privKey{priv: key}
}
```

Run:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/deploy.go
```

And you should see the address of your custom contract printed in your terminal.

## 3. Deploy to Rigil

Follow the same steps as listed above, but point your deploy script at the Rigil RPC after getting some faucet funds. 

Request [faucet funds here](https://faucet.rigil.suave.flashbots.net).

`deploy.go` should work as is, just adapt this block:

```go
var (
    // Target the Rigil RPC
	exNodeNetAddr = "https://rpc.rigil.suave.flashbots.net"
    // Insert a private key you own with some SUAVE ETH
	fundedAccount = newPrivKeyFromHex("<your_priv_key>")
	// The public address of a Kettle on Rigil
	exNodeEthAddr = common.HexToAddress("0626a5c68af88e43613f7f7cf5879d60f50033b3")
)
```
