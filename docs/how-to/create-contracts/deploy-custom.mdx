# Deploy a custom contract

Now, let's write our own simple contract that illustrates how to use confidential inputs. We'll also focus on **how to to deploy custom contracts**.

The following guides will provide more details about precompiles, the programming model, and the data flows we expect to see in SUAVE.

## 1. Write the contract

We have a number of example contracts already written in [`suave/sol/standard_peekers`](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/tree/main/suave/sol/standard_peekers) to give you inspiration.

Create a new file in that directory called `OnlyConfidential.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.8;

import "../libraries/Suave.sol";

contract OnlyConfidential {

	event SimResultEvent(
		uint64 egp
	);

	function fetchBidConfidentialBundleData() public returns (bytes memory) {
		require(Suave.isConfidential());

		bytes memory confidentialInputs = Suave.confidentialInputs();
		return abi.decode(confidentialInputs, (bytes));
	}


	// note: because of confidential execution,
    // you will not see your input as input to the function
	function helloWorld() external {
		// 0. ensure confidential execution
		require(Suave.isConfidential());

		// 1. fetch bundle data
		bytes memory bundleData = this.fetchBidConfidentialBundleData();

		// 2. sim bundle and get effective gas price
		uint64 effectiveGasPrice = Suave.simulateBundle(bundleData);

		emit SimResultEvent(effectiveGasPrice);

		// note: this function doesn't return anything
        // so this computation result will never land onchain
	}
}
```

This contract uses three new [precompiles](/technical/specs/rigil/precompiles):

1. `isConfidential` to ensure that only the MEVM(s) specified by the user can fetch the confidential data in transactions to this contract.
2. `confidentialInputs` to fetch the confidential data that was submitted along with the transaction that the user sent which specified this contract.
3. `simulateBundle` for no specific reason here other than to illustrate what you, as a contract creator, might want any MEVM allowed to see confidential data to do once they have fetched it.

## 2. Deploy locally

SUAVE contracts can be deployed using all existing Ethereum client providers (ethers, viem, geth...) and development toolkits (forge, hardhat, brownie...).

### Deploy with Forge

`forge` is a command-line tool from [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) that can compile and deploy smart contracts.

```bash
# assuming you've already created a project with `forge init`
forge build

# replace these values with your own as needed
export CONTRACT_NAME="MyContract"
# defaults for a local devnet with suave-geth:
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
export PRV_KEY=0x91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12

# assuming your contract name (in code) is the same as the filename
forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRV_KEY \
./src/${CONTRACT_NAME}.sol:$CONTRACT_NAME
```

_Example Result:_

```
No files changed, compilation skipped
Deployer: 0xBE69d72ca5f88aCba033a063dF5DBe43a4148De0
Deployed to: 0xcbdF0322Cd79212e10b0dB72D775aE05B99c1796
Transaction hash: 0x9ae80af40bdafbc706108446dbbf7761a59f5bf544b46c97b9b0851dddaa3927
```

### Deploy with Go

1. Generate the necessary artifacts. This can be done by running:

```bash
suave/scripts/contracts.sh build
```

2. Extend the `suave/e2e/contracts.go` by adding to the `var` block which declares all the contracts:

```go
OnlyConfidentialContract  = newArtifact("OnlyConfidential.sol/OnlyConfidential.json")
```

:::info Make sure to capitalize `OnlyConfidentialContract` so that it is exported from this file. :::

3. Edit the [contract deployment code](/how-to/send-transactions#2-deploy-a-contract) from the previous guide to look like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto/ecdsa"
	"fmt"

	_ "embed"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/crypto"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/suave/e2e"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/suave/sdk"
)

var (
	exNodeEthAddr = common.HexToAddress("b5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f")
	exNodeNetAddr = "http://localhost:8545"
	fundedAccount = newPrivKeyFromHex("91ab9a7e53c220e6210460b65a7a3bb2ca181412a8a7b43ff336b3df1737ce12")
)

var (
	onlyConfidentialArtifact = e2e.OnlyConfidentialContract
)

func main() {
    rpcClient, _ := rpc.Dial(exNodeNetAddr)
	mevmClt := sdk.NewClient(rpcClient, fundedAccount.priv, exNodeEthAddr)

	var onlyConfidentialContract *sdk.Contract
	_ = onlyConfidentialContract

	txnResult, err := sdk.DeployContract(onlyConfidentialArtifact.Code, mevmClt)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to deploy contract: %v", err)
	}
	receipt, err := txnResult.Wait()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to wait for transaction result: %v", err)
	}
	if receipt.Status == 0 {
		fmt.Errorf("Failed to deploy contract: %v", err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("- Example contract deployed: %s\n", receipt.ContractAddress)
	onlyConfidentialContract = sdk.GetContract(receipt.ContractAddress, onlyConfidentialArtifact.Abi, mevmClt)
}

// Helpers, not unique to SUAVE

type privKey struct {
	priv *ecdsa.PrivateKey
}

func newPrivKeyFromHex(hex string) *privKey {
	key, err := crypto.HexToECDSA(hex)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Sprintf("failed to parse private key: %v", err))
	}
	return &privKey{priv: key}
}
```

Run:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/deploy.go
```

And you should see the address of your custom contract printed in your terminal.

## 3. Deploy to Rigil

Follow the same steps as listed above, but point your deploy script at the Rigil RPC after getting some faucet funds.

Request [faucet funds here](https://faucet.rigil.suave.flashbots.net).

`deploy.go` should work as is, just adapt this block:

```go
var (
    // Target the Rigil RPC
	exNodeNetAddr = "https://rpc.rigil.suave.flashbots.net"
    // Insert a private key you own with some SUAVE ETH
	fundedAccount = newPrivKeyFromHex("<your_priv_key>")
	// The public address of a Kettle on Rigil
	exNodeEthAddr = common.HexToAddress("03493869959c866713c33669ca118e774a30a0e5")
)
```
