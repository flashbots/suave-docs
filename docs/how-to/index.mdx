SUAVE is focused on delivering credible, confidential computation that enables you to build better mechanisms.

## What can I do with SUAVE?

1. **Deploy more expressive smart contracts.** 
    - Contracts on SUAVE follow the same rules as on Ethereum, with the added advantage of being able to access additional precompiles available to serve any MEV application. We call this "builder solidity".

2. **Compute confidentially**. 
    - Builder solidity lets you request confidential computation, where your transaction data is encrypted to specific actors. Public contracts with verifiable logic, combined with confidential data, means that SUAVE can be seen as an open marketplace for mechanisms we can all inspect, collaborate on, and compete with to produce the most efficient MEV applications, while nevertheless protecting everyone's privacy.

> **SUAVE enables anyone to build and deploy MEV applications, on a decentralized network, which were not possible until today.**
