SUAVE is focused on delivering the properties you need: low latency, privacy, credible computation, and composability.

## What can I do with SUAVE?

1. **Deploy more expressive smart contracts.** 
    - Contracts on SUAVE follow the same rules as on Ethereum, with the added advantage of being able to access additional precompiles we have made available to serve any MEV application. We call this builder solidity.

2. **Enjoy confidential execution**. 
    - Builder solidity lets you define computation that can occur "off-chain", that is, where the transaction data is not exposed to everyone using SUAVE, but is encrypted to specific actors. This creates a public and transparent marketplace of applications in which we can inspect, collaborate, and compete to produce the most efficient order flow auctions, or block building algorithms etc., while nevertheless protecting the data of the people who use those applications.

> **You can build new applications that you cannot build on Ethereum in a decentralized way today.**  

Initially, we will support applications that require:

1. **private data**, e.g., auctions, block building
2. **coordination within block times**, e.g., block building, trade routing and filling
3. **access to fresh off-chain data**, e.g., trading strategies conditional on centralized exchange prices or transactions that are conditional on other transactions
4. **commitments** of various kinds, e.g., shared sequencers for rollups, new kinds of DEXes and bridges
5. **too much gas to do on-chain** because of how much compute they use, e.g., block building.

In this section, you'll find all of our recipes. 

The tutorials are intended to get you from 0 to 1. These "how to guides" will help you get from 1 to wherever else you want to go. They do not provide history and background explanation: they show you how to do interesting and delicious things.
