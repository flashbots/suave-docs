If you'd like to run the suave-geth binaries yourself, this is the guide for you.

### What you need

1. [Install Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### What to do

Clone the repo and build SUAVE:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
make suave
```

Run this command:
```bash
suave --suave.dev
```

### What to do next

Test your node by deploying a contract and sending it some transactions:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

The output should be roughly similar to the below (addresses, txns, and ids will differ):

```bash
suave-geth$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
Step 0: Create and fund test accounts
- Funded test account: 0x66d5a8D6B34329c0639071275b3d78D29e11EbC6 (100000000)
Step 1: Deploy mev-share contract
- Mev share contract deployed: 0x8f21Fdd6B4f4CacD33151777A46c122797c8BF17
Step 2: Send bid
- Bid sent at txn: 0xb49debcdead2b306d6ab6282b88fdad7c8d6a33d87df34b79f56d141eae7c08a
- Bid id: 30bbc65298f24e67aaf5c95bf5f0686c
Step 3: Send backrun
- Backrun sent at txn: 0xcf7880e61e94aaab48c60655c321716ecab6edab752586448b0412e93a969889
- Backrun bid id: db98b83d02694fc2b13c042ad22c233
```

#### Using the console

You can also run any familiar Geth command you like. Start by generating a new account:

```bash
suave --suave account new
```

If the `--datadir` flag is not set, a geth client stores data in the `$HOME/.ethereum` directory. Depending on the chain you use, it creates a subdirectory. For example, if you run Sepolia, geth creates `$HOME/.ethereum/sepolia/`. So, if you use the `--suave` flag, your data ends up in `$HOME/.ethereum/suave/...`.

You can attach to the usual Geth javascript console to get any interactive data you need with:

```bash
suave attach /tmp/geth.ipc
```

From within the console, you can run:

```bash
eth.accounts[0]
```

Which should return `"0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f"` which is the account we unlocked when starting the MEVM.

```bash
eth.getBalance(eth.accounts[0])
```

Should return a really large number `1.1579...e+77`. If you try `eth.getBalance("<your_new_address>")` instead, you should see `0`.

If you try:

```bash
web3.eth.blockNumber
```

It should tell you the block height of your local network.

        If you are seeing:<br/>
        <code>
        "cp: cannot create regular file '/bin/suave': Permission denied"
        </code><br/><br/>
        it is most likely because you have not set your GOPATH correctly. You can do so by running:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        export GOPATH=$HOME/go
        </code>
