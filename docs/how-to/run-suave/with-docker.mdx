If you'd like to run SUAVE in Docker, this is the guide for you.

### What you need

1. [Install and start Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too, which should be part of the regular Docker setup (check with `docker compose version` or `docker-compose version`).

### What to do

Clone suave-geth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```

Get to the right place in the repo:

```bash
cd suave-geth/
```

Run SUAVE:

```bash
make devnet-up
```

        It is likely best to create a new user group for Docker, rather than run
        the above command as sudo. You can do by running:
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre>sudo usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker</pre>
      </div>
    </div>

### Testing transactions

Test your node by deploying a contract and sending it some transactions:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

You should see something like the below printed to your terminal (addresses, txns, and ids will differ):

```bash
suave-geth$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
Step 0: Create and fund test accounts

Step 1: Deploy mev-share contract
- Mev share contract deployed: 0x8f21Fdd6B4f4CacD33151777A46c122797c8BF17
Step 2: Send bid
- Bid sent at txn: 0xb49debcdead2b306d6ab6282b88fdad7c8d6a33d87df34b79f56d141eae7c08a
- Bid id: 30bbc65298f24e67aaf5c95bf5f0686c
Step 3: Send backrun
- Backrun sent at txn: 0xcf7880e61e94aaab48c60655c321716ecab6edab752586448b0412e93a969889
- Backrun bid id: db98b83d02694fc2b13c042ad22c233
```

If you'd like to examine the Go code responsible for deploying contracts and sending transactions, you can do so [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

5. You can stop your docker containers with:

```bash
make devnet-down
```

        Make sure that Docker is running. On most Linux machines, you can do
        this with:
        <br />
        <pre>sudo systemctl start docker</pre>
        <br />
        You can check the current status with:
        <br />
        <pre>sudo systemctl status docker</pre>
        <br />
        If you installed Docker and still run into issues with docker-compose,
        you can try:
        <br />
        <pre>sudo apt install docker-compose</pre>
      </div>

  <summary>Unsupported version</summary>

      <div>
        If you're running an older version of Docker, you may get a message that
        looks like this:
        <br />
        <pre>
          ERROR: Version in "././suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" is
          unsupported.
        </pre>
        <br />
        Go to the file in "/suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" and change the
        first line to use <b>3.3</b> rather than <b>3.8</b>.
