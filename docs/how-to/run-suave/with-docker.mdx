If you'd like to run SUAVE in Docker, this is the guide for you.

### What you need

1. Install and start Docker. You can find general directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    1. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, we recommend [this specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too. The should just happen when you install Docker.
    1. Check with `docker-compose version` (Docker Engine) or `docker compose version` (Docker Desktop).
3. We do not have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements. This section should work on most consumer laptops.

### What to do

1. Clone suave-geth:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```
2. Get to the right place in the repo:
```bash
cd suave-geth/
```
3. Run SUAVE:
```bash
make devnet-up
```

        It is likely best to create a new user group for Docker, rather than run the above command as <code>sudo</code>. You can do by running:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        </code><br/>
        <code>
        newgrp docker
        </code>

### Testing transactions

4. Test your node by deploying a contract and sending it some transactions:
```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```
You should see something like the below printed to your terminal (addresses, txns, and ids will differ):
```bash
suave-geth$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
Step 0: Create and fund test accounts
- Funded test account: 0x66d5a8D6B34329c0639071275b3d78D29e11EbC6 (100000000)
Step 1: Deploy mev-share contract
- Mev share contract deployed: 0x8f21Fdd6B4f4CacD33151777A46c122797c8BF17
Step 2: Send bid
- Bid sent at txn: 0xb49debcdead2b306d6ab6282b88fdad7c8d6a33d87df34b79f56d141eae7c08a
- Bid id: 30bbc65298f24e67aaf5c95bf5f0686c
Step 3: Send backrun
- Backrun sent at txn: 0xcf7880e61e94aaab48c60655c321716ecab6edab752586448b0412e93a969889
- Backrun bid id: db98b83d02694fc2b13c042ad22c233
```

If you'd like to examine the Go code responsible for deploying contracts and sending transactions, you can do so [here](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go).

5. You can stop your docker containers with:
```bash
make devnet-down
```

### Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>2. Docker not running</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Make sure that Docker is running. On most Linux machines, you can do this with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl start docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        You can check the current status with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl status docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        If you installed Docker and still run into issues with docker-compose, you can try:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo apt install docker-compose
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>

  <summary>3. Unsupported version</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        If you're running an older version of Docker, you may get a message that looks like this:<br/><br/>
        <code>
        ERROR: Version in "././suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml" is unsupported.
        </code><br/><br/>
        Go to the file in <code>/suave/devenv/docker-compose.yml</code> and change the first line to use <code>3.3</code> rather than <code>3.8</code>.
