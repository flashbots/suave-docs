# Run SUAVE Locally

Our first goal is to start a "Kettle". Kettles house all components necessary to perform confidential compute and are the main protocol actor in the SUAVE protocol.

Here is the architecture of a node on the Rigil Testnet. We'll be running all the stuff within the purple square.

You can read more about exactly what a Kettle contains in [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).

## Get Started

There are two different approaches you can take to local setup:

1. [Docker](/how-to/run-suave/with-docker)
2. [Building from source](/how-to/run-suave/build-yourself)



### Clone the [suave-geth](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/) repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
```


### Building from source

```sh
# build the binary
$ make suave
```

Now you have the `suave` binary in your Go bin directory. You can check this by running:

```bash
$ which suave
$ suave --version
```

Start the local devnet like this:

```bash
$ suave --suave.dev
```

### Using Docker

```bash
# spin up the local devnet with docker-compose
$ make devnet-up

# check that the containers are running
$ docker ps

# you can stop the local devnet like this
$ make devnet-down
```

### Testing the devnet

Create a few example transactions:

```bash
$ go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

Execute a RPC request with curl like this:

```bash
$ curl 'http://localhost:8545' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_blockNumber", "params":[], "id":83 }'
```
