# Run SUAVE Locally

Our first goal is to start a "Kettle". Kettles house all components necessary to perform confidential compute and are the main protocol actor in the SUAVE protocol.

The Rigil Testnet can be represented as below. We'll be running all the stuff within the purple square.

You can read more about exactly what a Kettle contains in [architecture section of the Technical Specs](/technical/specs/rigil/#architecture).

## Get Started

There are two different approaches you can take to local setup: 

1. [Use Docker](/how-to/run-suave/with-docker), or 
2. [Build and run the binaries yourself](/how-to/run-suave/build-yourself).
