# Send Requests on SUAVE

If you followed the [previous guide](/how-to/run-suave), you will have SUAVE running locally, either in Docker or via the binaries themselves.

In either case, you can cause a series of transactions to occur by running:

```bash
go run suave/devenv/cmd/main.go
```

[[ðŸ”—source](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/devenv/cmd/main.go)]

This guide will show you how to craft such transactions yourself.

## RPC and SDK

In order to keep some data in transactions confidential, SUAVE JSON-RPC extends the usual Ethereum JSOPN-RPC methods. Some methods in the `eth_` namespace are overloaded to support confidential compute requests.

1. **eth_sendRawTransaction**

Creates a new message call transaction or a contract creation for any signed `ConfidentialComputeRequest`.

2. **eth_call**

Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain. It follows the same format as the default `eth_call` with two extra parameters:

- `IsConfidential`: Set to true to execute as a confidential request and access the [`MEVM`](/technical/specs/rigil/precompiles) methods.
- `ExecutionAddress`: `address` - (optional) The execution address that performs the execution.

3. **eth_executionAddress**

Returns the list of available addresses in the Kettle to execute the confidential compute request.

The [SUAVE SDK](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth/blob/main/suave/sdk/sdk.go) makes it easy to interact with the extended RPC and we will be using it in this guide.
