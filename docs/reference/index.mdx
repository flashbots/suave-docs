## Foundation

After [formalizing the threat posed by MEV](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05234.pdf), and creating [mev-geth](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth) to begin addressing it, Flashbots has collaborated with many people and organizations to build neutral open-source software like [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) and [mev-share](https://github.com/flashbots/MEV-Share). Our work has prevented the worst effects of MEV, though many critical problems remain.

To read more about what inspires us, and why we are working on SUAVE, we recommend [this post](https://writings.flashbots.net/the-future-of-mev-is-suave).

This section describes how SUAVE works, and provides up-to-date reference material for all the APIs and precompiles SUAVE gives you access to.

## SUAVE Plan

SUAVE is our means of _keeping block building decentralized_ by creating an _open marketplace for mechanisms_ that handle block building and orderflow auctions. Such a marketplace requires its own network. As an open marketplace for mechanisms, SUAVE can also act as a _shared sequencing layer_ for other blockchains, helping them remain resilient to economic forces that encourage centralization and/or specialization over time.

The high level plan is:

1. **Permissionless programmability** 
    - make it possible to create MEV applications as smart contracts, written in [builder solidity](/reference/builder-solidity)
2. **Trust minimization**
    - replace trusted third parties (TTPs) with trusted execution environments (TEEs)
3. **Decentralized execution**
    - geographically and administratively, using threshold MPC, FHE etc as they become viable

Technically, we will achieve this with the "MEVM": our adaption of the EVM with a new runtime and APIs. These APIs enable you to leverage new precompiles in what we call "builder solidity", which is solidity as you know and love it, but extended so that you can create MEV applications. 

## *Refers to notes

In this section, you'll find up-to-date and succinct descriptions of each part of SUAVE and the MEVM. Once you're familiar wih the tutorials and how to guides, this section should help you create new and innovative mechanisms of your own on SUAVE.
