Each of the pages in this section describes one of the ways in which SUAVE extends Solidity and gives you, a MEV application developer, unique advantages.

<DocCardList />

In brief, SUAVE enables you to:

- 🛠 Build blocks on other chains

- 🧑‍💻 Define private compute

- 🕵️‍♀️ Store private data

- 🧩 Interface with many different MEV components, meaning that you can
    - ⚡ Plug into existing MEV infra: i.e sending bundles to block builders, relays, validators or sequencers
    - 🤖 Build totally new MEV infra: i.e. create unique SUAPPs on SUAVE
