# RPC Key Differences

In order to keep some data in transactions confidential, SUAVE JSON-RPC extends the usual Ethereum JSON-RPC methods. Some methods in the `eth_` namespace are overloaded to support confidential compute requests.

1. **eth_sendRawTransaction**

Creates a new message call transaction or a contract creation for any signed `ConfidentialComputeRequest`.

2. **eth_call**

Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain. It follows the same format as the default `eth_call` with two extra parameters:

- `IsConfidential`: Set to true to execute as a confidential request and access the [`MEVM`](/technical/specs/toliman/precompiles) methods.
- `ExecutionAddress`: `address` - (optional) The execution address that performs the execution.

3. **eth_kettleAddress**

Returns the list of available addresses in the Kettle to execute the confidential compute request.

### Testing the RPC

The easiest way to test your connection to an RPC endpoint is via a simple curl command.

#### Remote curl request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_kettleAddress","params":[],"id":1}' \
  https://rpc.toliman.suave.flashbots.net
```

#### Local curl request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_kettleAddress","params":[],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545

```

#### Expected Response

If your connection is working properly you should get a response such as:

```JSON
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x30870","id":1}
```

Note that the only difference between these two is the URL at the end of the curl request.

### SUAVE Transactions

The example above follows the [exact same API interface](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-eth) as the original go-ethereum client. However, if we grab a random transaction hash from the [Rigil Explorer](https://explorer.toliman.suave.flashbots.net/), we can see the core difference with the SUAVE Rigil RPC: a new SUAVE transaction type.

#### Remote curl request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getTransactionByHash",
    "params": [
      "0x294b510e4fd257dec3d27b051f157489446c38828ff5f6b8d8c194797c6ddaab"
    ],
    "id": 1
  }' \
  https://rpc.toliman.suave.flashbots.net
```

This response has a couple fields that aren't in your traditional Ethereum transaction type, namely:

- `confidentialComputeResult`
- `executionNode`
- `requestRecord`
