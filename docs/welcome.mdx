# Welcome to SUAVE

If MEV remains centralized, we cannot realise the promises that crypto offers.

SUAVE unifies how we coordinate without forcing any one mechanism onto everyone. SUAVE does not compete with other blockchains: it is intended to aggregate and coordinate all the things that ultimately change the state of other chains.

SUAVE is a permissionless and open marketplace for many different mechanisms. SUAVE enables anyone to innovate, design, and deploy new mechanisms, which enables us to (among other things) _decentralize block building_ for all blockchains. Such "MEV applications" can provide a sustainable [defender's advantage](https://vitalik.ca/general/2016/12/29/pos_design.html) against centralizing economic forces both within and beyond crypto. 

Reducing the economic centralization pressure on other networks enables:

  <GridBlock symbol="III." title="Validators">
  to maximize revenue
  </GridBlock>
  <GridBlock symbol="IV." title="Humans">
  to transact fairly, with the best execution.
  </GridBlock>
</Grid>

SUAVE is _unifying infrastructure_ that allows rational MEV actors to profit more, aligning our incentives around shared ownership rather than private economies of scale.

We must make sure block building - and the power it implies - ends up meaningfully decentralized, because crypto must end up decentralized, because humanity needs decentralization in its financial systems, now more than ever.

## About this site

This site encourages you to move through a specific flow in order to start building the _future of coordination_. 

1. Begin with **[tutorials](/tutorials/index)**. These are _learning-oriented_. They focus on practical skills, not theoretical knowledge. Our goal with the tutorials is that you enjoy the experience and gain confidence, not that you become an expert.
2. Grow with the **[how-to guides](/how-to/index)**. These are _task-oriented_. You can think of them like recipes. Following a recipe requires basic competence (hence why we start with tutorials). Recipes do not give you context or history: they will help you do stuff. All the recipes taken together help frame the picture of what SUAVE can enable you to do, in general.
3. Consult the **[references](/reference/index)**. These are _information-oriented_ and provide you with up-to-date certainty about what interfaces and precompiles SUAVE provides and where to find them. These are our treasure maps, which tell you what you need to know about the territory you're working in, without having to go and constantly check yourself.
4. Refine your **[understanding](/understand/index)**. These are _discussion-oriented_. These are designed to provide you with insight into the "deep why". Why is it meaningful to work on MEV? The discussions this section invites weave everything together.

## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV. We achieve this in three ways: _Illuminate the Dark Forest_ of MEV activity, _Democratize Extraction_, and _Distribute Benefits_.

We focus on:

- _Product_: engineering products to fulfill our mission.
- _Coordination_: organizing processes, interfacing with external teams in the ecosystem, and maximizing our impact.
- _Research_: open, transparent, and collaborative research to tackle short and long term research questions relevant to MEV.

You can interact with Flashbots on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7hvTycdNcK), [Github](https://github.com/flashbots/), and our [Discourse forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/). We have dedicated channels on Discord for each of our efforts and welcome your contributions. Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each Github repository.
